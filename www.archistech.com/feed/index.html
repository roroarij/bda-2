				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><img class="size-full wp-image-16903 alignleft" src="https://www.archistech.com/files/2024/03/Untitled-design-2024-02-21T120729.761.png" alt="" width="300" height="225" />Thousands of organizations worldwide remember the Bumblebee malware that surfaced in March 2022, allowing dozens of cybercriminal threat actors to drop payloads on targeted victims. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although researchers noticed this malware loader disappeared in October 2023 after its long run of terror, Proofpoint, an enterprise security firm, noted its revival this February, about four months later. With it surfaced new malware variants hackers are now using as part of new campaigns comprising thousands of emails. Below, we'll relay how these emails work and how businesses can protect themselves. </span></p>
<p><b>How Do the Emails Work?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The emails, which come from "info@quarlesaa[.]com", have subject lines that read "voicemail February" since they try to convince employees that they have a missed voice message. Suppose the employee clicks on the Microsoft OneDrive URL. In that case, it redirects them to Word files with names like "ReleaseEvans#96.docm" or some variation while impersonating a company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Launching the link initiates the PowerShell command that runs the Bumblebee loader. From there, the attackers use anything, from deployed ransomware to macro-themed attacks, to collect information, ask for ransom, or bring down a company or competitor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This campaign is different from previous ones since some previously observed methods included URLs that led employees to download DLL to initiate Bumblebee. Other methods include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Using HTML attachments that encourage HTML smuggling that pushes a RAR file and exploits WinRAR flaw CVE-2023-38831 for a Bumblebee download</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Zipped VBS attachments with password protection that use PowerShell to download the malware loader</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Zipped LNK files that download executable files with Bumblebee </span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>What Can You Do To Keep From Becoming a Victim?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whatever form Bumblebee malware takes, it's best to know how to identify threats to avoid them. Threat research shows that current sender addresses and OneDrive URLs coincide with previous TA579 activities, so organizations should look for malicious emails with the above information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alongside staying away from any link that downloads and executes Bumblebee, your company should implement basic security practices, such as employee training that teaches your workers how to identify scams like phishing emails. Unfortunately, even with this, there is more complex and sophisticated malware that may trick your workers, so try security scanning software for emails. This software notes and flags all messages it believes to be malware before they reach your employees, creating more steps the malware has to go through. That lessens its chances of affecting your company. </span></p>
<p><b>Don't Become a Victim of Malware!</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Researchers believe this campaign will continue until the summer. So, take the right precautions and don't become one of the companies that fall for phishing emails. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><img class="size-full wp-image-16934 alignleft" src="https://www.archistech.com/files/2024/03/Untitled-design-2024-03-06T144305.870.png" alt="" width="300" height="225" />Three decades after Adobe invented the PDF format, most people still choose Adobe to read, edit, or transform PDFs. Acrobat is everywhere on desktops, mobile devices, and the web. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Adobe has decided to take things a notch higher with a new AI tool for Adobe Acrobat that aims to transform the digital document experience.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Adobe describes this new Adobe Acrobat AI integration as a chatbot or conversational engine that can summarize files, ask and answer questions, and give recommendations based on the content. In other words, users can “converse” with documents to get the information they need.  </span></p>
<p><b>AI Features in Adobe Acrobat </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The new tool runs on the same AI and ML models behind Adobe Liquid Mode. Besides the usual generative summary creation, the enhanced Acrobat with AI technology offers new capabilities, including: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">AI Assistant: This new AI tool for Adobe Acrobat uses an intuitive conversational interface to recommend questions users may wish to explore based on a PDF’s content and answer questions about that content. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Intelligent citations: The tool generates citations that allow users to verify answers provided by AI Assistant.  </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Easy navigation: It can create clickable links that jump directly to specific information in long PDFs. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Formatted output: Users can ask the AI chatbot to merge and format information into easy-to-read copy for emails, reports, presentations, and more. You can easily cut, paste, and share, thanks to a copy button. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Customers can use AI Assistant with just about any document format. The company also mentions that AI Assistant adheres to strict data security guidelines and neither stores nor uses customer document information for training without user consent. </span></p>
<p><b>Enhanced Productivity </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This Adobe Acrobat AI upgrade aims to reduce time-consuming tasks related to working with massive text documents. Thanks to Adobe Acrobat automation tools, students can shorten their time scouring research material and focus more on insights and analysis.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Project managers can scan, summarize, and distribute meeting highlights in seconds. At the same time, sales professionals can respond to client requests in minutes and personalize pitches made to prospective clients.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By streamlining the time it takes to scan through a contract or compose an email, AI Assistant delivers productivity to consumers everywhere. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that’s not all for the new AI tool for Adobe Acrobat. The company has a clear roadmap of future AI-powered functions in Adobe Acrobat it plans to roll out.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">These include AI-powered authoring, editing, formatting, the ability to collect data from multiple documents, and integrations with its Firefly family of creative, generative AI models. </span></p>
<p><b>Pricing and Availability </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Adobe has initially rolled out a beta phase of the AI Assistant for free to Acrobat customers on Standard, Pro, and Teams subscription plans across the web and desktop. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Paying customers will have access to the new AI tool for Adobe Acrobat at no additional cost while the product is in beta. When AI Assistant is out of beta, Reader and Acrobat customers will have access to the Assistant’s full range of capabilities through a new add-on subscription plan.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><img class="size-full wp-image-16925 alignleft" src="https://www.archistech.com/files/2024/03/Untitled-design-2024-03-06T132318.749.png" alt="" width="300" height="225" />From classrooms to office board meetings, Google Workspace helps over three billion users worldwide draft documents, create charts, and prepare presentations. It's convenient, with easier accessibility across devices, unlike Microsoft suites. It is also much more cost-effective, with many in-app options that small business owners can tailor to their needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the new Google Workspace update, all of this just got better for small businesses. As a start, Google announced a crucial change hitting Sheets, Slides, and Docs (taking effect from March 1 to March 4, 2024, according to the Google Workspace release calendar). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For many business owners, it's a long-awaited change. Here's how it might revolutionize the workspace's user interface.</span></p>
<p><b>Before the Google Workspace Update For Businesses</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">People widely revere Google Workspace for its simple, collaboration-friendly platform that allows anyone with the same link to write in and edit a page simultaneously. Still, sometimes, things get a little messy. For example, your business could have dozens of individuals commenting on the document, causing sidebar popups to overtake the interface and complicate navigation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Are you a writer trying to tackle a sea of suggestions? How can you determine where to implement changes and remove those you've already made? With the Google Workspace update, this will soon be a thing of the past. </span></p>
<p><b>What Your Small Business Should Expect With This Latest Update to Google Workspace</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One of the most notable improvements to the workspace is the new and improved sidebar opening up when you hit the "comments" button. In most Google Drive applications, including Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides, you'll now have several options for viewing information. </span></p>
<p><b>All Comments</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you click "All Comments," you can see every comment like before. Now, though, you can also collapse the sidebar for a much cleaner interface. Upon doing so, circular icons pop up with each editor's profile picture, and you can hover above the icons to read each comment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All the feedback is still at your fingertips but not in your face. Your employees may focus better this way, especially if they aren't tackling feedback at that moment. </span></p>
<p><b>For You</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Are the document's editors not directing all the comments toward you? Then, it's unnecessary to view them. Click on the "For You" section and only view the notes editors tag you in! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Like the "All Comments" section, you can collapse this, too. That way, the only popups should be ones mentioning you specifically.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">These seem like minor updates, but they could be monumental for daily collaborators. </span></p>
<p><b>Other Recent Updates From Google For Business Users</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This update follows Google's recent "@ button" tool update from October 2023 that utilizes smart chip technology—hit "Enter" in a Google Doc and watch it automatically suggest an @ symbol to insert an email address, calendar event, and more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other news, the upcoming update promises ease of use without admin console control. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><img class="size-full wp-image-16857 alignleft" src="https://www.archistech.com/files/2024/03/Untitled-design-2024-02-08T113713.368.png" alt="" width="300" height="225" />Is yours one of the thousands of corporations encouraging people to return to the office? Perhaps your employees aren’t budging on discontinuing their digital freedom for more traditional arrangements. You’re not alone if your business is struggling to find a balance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, while you work out the details, you’ll want to consider remote work security measures for your business. If not, your operation will be wide open to those who don’t have your bottom line or best interests at heart. Here’s more about how to take a stand on cybersecurity in and out of the office.</span></p>
<p><b>The Remote Workplace: Top Security Concerns</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Remote work benefits your employees’ mental health, which benefits productivity. Unfortunately, just one swoop of a well-planned cybercrime can erode any perks your business enjoyed from happier employees. Here’s the problem:</span></p>
<p><b>Larger Attack Surface</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Staff members using devices within a single location offer cybercriminals a narrower target. With multiple locations, everyone’s personal devices and porous networks accessing your company’s internal infrastructure can spell disaster.</span></p>
<p><b>Zero Employee Awareness</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before working remotely, nobody thought about connection security because your business’s tech support handled it. Why would remote work security differ if your employees’ habits and training haven’t evolved?</span></p>
<p><b>Infrastructure Vulnerability</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As pandemic restrictions gradually lifted, many remote workers have migrated to public Wi-Fi access libraries, coffee shops, or restaurants. These locations allow all parties present to join their network, leaving an opportunity for nefarious patrons to exploit an unaware user’s login credentials, passwords, answers to security questions, and much more. </span></p>
<p><b>Businesses Need To Be Developing Remote Work Security Now and Later</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A small business owner might already appreciate the benefits of remote or hybrid positions that empower staff to work virtually anywhere. Can you afford to exchange sensitive information for flexibility, though? Of course not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Try implementing the following remote work security best practices to protect your people and digital assets:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Awareness: Does your team know about secure remote work measures? Training and ongoing discussions increase awareness and proactivity. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Infrastructure: Has your business supplied devices? Equip them with protective software to detect and prevent attacks. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Framework: A zero-trust framework prevents unauthorized access to digital assets. Authentication is essential for all your network’s users from any location. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Analytics: Everyone uses their devices differently. Could AI and machine learning applications help you identify and analyze suspicious account activity?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Embrace Remote Work Security and Watch Your Company Thrive</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The rise and perpetuation of remote positions require appropriate security measures. Take heart; facilitating work-from-anywhere positions can greatly benefit business owners when designed correctly.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><img class="size-full wp-image-16891 alignleft" src="https://www.archistech.com/files/2024/03/Untitled-design-2024-02-19T114056.681.png" alt="" width="300" height="225" />LastPass, the password management app serving more than 33 million users, recently warned iOS users about a fake version of its app, which managed to scale through the security review process on the Apple App Store. The fake version mirrored the original logo and dropped a letter from the name to arrive at LassPass.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Parvati Patel created the LassPass on the Apple App Store. They most likely created the app to steal credentials from unsuspecting people who may be looking for a digital password manager. They aimed to get many people to download the fake version of the app and transfer their ID numbers, passwords, and crypto seed phrases into it, allowing the threat actors behind the app to get into the victims’ accounts and steal their money and identities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s unclear how many people (if any) fell for the fake LastPass app.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><b>Typosquatting</b></span><b> and How To Avoid It</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The LassPass phishing attempt is a new take at an old trick known as “typosquatting.” It involves cybercriminals luring people to fake sites by misspelling the original name of a popular site in the hopes that the potential victims will not notice the difference before handing over sensitive information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The app version of this trick is slightly different because the threat actor is banking on the victims not being able to differentiate between the original app and the fake one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You can avoid becoming a victim of typosquatting or cloning in mobile app stores by doing the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Click the app URL on the original author’s website. LastPass has links to the original app on their website. Clicking on it instead of trying to find the app yourself on the app store will help you not be a victim to the phishing attack.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Pay more attention to social proof. LastPass is a company with millions of users. You should be able to differentiate the original app from the fake LassPass on the Apple App Store by looking at metrics like date added, number of downloads, version history, reviews, and more. Don’t download the app if anything looks off.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Check the app details. Threat actors always make obvious errors in the attempt to game the security checks on the various app stores. A typo, incomplete app description, grammatical blunders, and failure to use a business name as the app developer are dead giveaways of the scam.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Should Users Expect Another LassPass on the Apple App Store?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apple boasts a robust security review system for weeding out fake and malware-ridden apps on their app store. Thus, the latest breach raised many eyebrows. It’s still unclear how LassPass got on the Apple App Store, but we’ll likely see another attempt like this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Future threat actors might not clone LastPass again. Still, they may attempt to piggyback off the popularity of the thousands of other apps trusted by millions of users around the globe. Make sure to proceed with caution if anything seems out of the ordinary.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><img class="size-full wp-image-16834 alignleft" src="https://www.archistech.com/files/2024/03/Untitled-design-2024-02-05T105517.852.png" alt="" width="300" height="225" />As a business leader, you want to protect your network from hacking and implement multi-factor authentication across your many accounts and devices. While these measures can boost your cybersecurity, hackers can exploit a few loopholes to infiltrate your account. Learn why you'll need to protect your accounts from unauthorized users further. </span></p>
<p><b>What Is Multi-Factor Authentication?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">MFA is considered more secure because it requires users to enter more than just an account password to verify their identity. Having someone enter an additional authentication factor, such as a one-time password or SMS code, makes hacking more difficult in theory. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Users can keep their accounts secure by implementing any of the following factors that differentiate each user's identity:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Something you know: Devices will ask you to enter a password, PIN, or security question answer that only you should know. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Something you have: The possession factor includes other devices or accounts you own. You can prove your identity via an email, phone call, or one-time password token. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Something you are: Also known as biometric authentication, this factor includes tactics like fingerprint scanning and facial recognition. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Somewhere you are: Physical location becomes key for the account to confirm your user identity. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Something you do: Devices can learn your behaviors while online and use them to determine whether it's you logging on.  </span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Common Multi-Factor Authentication Weaknesses</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While it's true that using multi-factor authentication is better than having no security measures in place, hackers can still infiltrate your accounts with social engineering and phishing. Cybercriminals can figure out passwords and common possession factors like SMS messages if they successfully execute a phishing attack to retrieve personal information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Requiring MFA for all accounts within your business could become counterproductive since employees might lose access if they don't have the proper authentication factors. Navigating these weaknesses is essential for getting the most out of MFA and protecting your business from security breaches. </span></p>
<p><b>How To Boost Your Business's Cybersecurity With MFA</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Don't ditch MFA measures because of a few weaknesses. Instead, continue to ask for authentication in highly secure ways.</span></p>
<p><b>Implement Risk-Based Authentication</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Experts recommend using risk-based authentication to provide extra security when user activity raises some concerns. This activity includes:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Logging in from an unknown device</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Logging in at a location considered high-risk</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Logging in outside of the desired IP range</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Risk-based authentication can help you verify that whoever's logging on is authorized to do so.</span></p>
<p><b>Use Passkeys</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Passkeys increase your security measures as an extension of the knowledge and possession factors. Users will possess a special device, such as a mobile phone, and use either a PIN or biometric factor to receive access. The device then displays a cryptographic key. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An algorithm generates a random string of characters to serve as the account's additional authentication factor. Passkeys resist phishing attacks, making them one of the most secure authentication factors. </span></p>
<p><b>Contact Industry Experts for Assistance</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Make your business as secure as possible with multi-factor authentication and other recommended measures. Let a cybersecurity expert guide you to business success. Contact our professionals today to learn more. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><img class="size-full wp-image-16897 alignleft" src="https://www.archistech.com/files/2024/03/Untitled-design-2024-02-19T120243.839.png" alt="" width="300" height="225" />Eye-catching images are a critical part of any content strategy. However, finding the perfect visual to include with a blog, social media post, or advertisement can be tough for businesses’ creative teams.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The new AI image editing tools in Microsoft Copilot make it easier than ever to create unique, eye-catching images in minutes. Upgrades to the Dall-E-powered AI art generator allow further customization of images to match the vision and company’s brand better using a sleeker and more user-friendly interface. It only takes a few seconds and a couple of clicks to generate customized visuals, even for users without design experience. </span></p>
<p><b>What to Expect from Copilot’s Upgrade </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The recent upgrades to Microsoft Copilot’s interface include both capability and UI improvements to make the tool more valuable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first notable change to the tool is the look and feel of the homepage, which now features a carousel of generated images and suggested prompts to create one-of-a-kind images. The chat box for prompts appears at the bottom of the page. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Creating images in Copilot remains simple: Once you enter your prompt, the software will produce four images to select from. It’s here that the upgrade shines, as you can click on the image you want and make it fully custom using the web app Designer. Designer provides powerful AI image editing tools for users working the web or with Copilot in Windows. </span></p>
<p><b>Image Customization With Designer</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The new Designer feature makes it possible to tweak AI-generated images in seconds without leaving the chat box. Using text-to-image prompts, you can change the image right on the canvas. Some of the changes you can make include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Enhance or change colors within the image</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Blur or remove the background</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Highlight specific parts of the image</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Change the art style</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Change the shape of the image (square to landscape, for example)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Crop the image</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Add filters</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Add or remove elements of the image </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ultimately, the addition of Designer to Copilot makes it easier for businesses’ creative teams to harness the power of AI for rapid content creation. Instead of investing in bland stock photography or settling for “good enough” images, you can better engage your audience with custom visuals that better reflect your business’s brand. </span></p>
<p><b>Making the Most of AI-Generated Images with Microsoft Copilot</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Most of the features of the upgraded Microsoft Copilot are free to personal users. Still, the paid Copilot Pro option increases the functionality of the AI image editing tools. Microsoft promises increased capabilities in the future that will help content creators even more effectively visualize their ideas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For now, the in-line editing capabilities of the upgraded Microsoft Copilot represent a big step forward in the usability of AI-generated images. While Dall-E-powered art generators can produce attractive and usable images, many business owners need the ability to make them even better and more in line with their brands. The Microsoft Copilot upgrade makes this possible, allowing you to generate and tweak AI images efficiently without sacrificing creativity. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><img class="size-full wp-image-16850 alignleft" src="https://www.archistech.com/files/2024/03/Untitled-design-2024-02-06T144036.985.png" alt="" width="300" height="225" />Establishments struggling in today’s fast-paced business environment have countless reasons for not hitting the heights they envisioned. It could be anything from regulatory bottlenecks to increasing competition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, one reason some of them fail to acknowledge is the lack of productivity. Thankfully, the modern world offers plenty of software to address this issue. In particular, boosting productivity with time management software can be a great way to improve your business. Discover more about how the software can improve your bottom line and work-life balance below.</span></p>
<p><b>Enhanced Project Visibility</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first step to productivity improvement is knowing what your employees are working on and how they are spending their time throughout the workday. Quality time tracking and management software allows you to see how projects are progressing, who is working on what, and more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With these insights, you can streamline projects and tasks and identify areas for change. For example, you can re-prioritize tasks or reallocate sub-tasks to optimize the workflow.</span></p>
<p><b>Improved Accountability</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Business owners boosting productivity with time management software can monitor employee activity without semblance of micromanagement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For example, managers can remotely see what employees have accomplished over the workday instead of asking for hourly or midday updates. They can also see employees who need commendation and those who may require more encouragement or further training.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On their part, team members will have another incentive to avoid distractions and focus on tasks with more people working hard to reach set milestones. This is especially true for time tracker software that allows employers to show a productivity leaderboard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The result is a significant boost in overall productivity.</span></p>
<p><b>Improved Scheduling</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Missed deadlines are a nightmare for every business owner. Whether you have a hospitality business serving continental meals to customers or a digital business building online assets, every customer expects to get their order fulfilled on schedule.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Repeated failure in this regard will undoubtedly harm your reputation and affect your bottom line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Quality time management systems will give you a historical view of how long it can take to complete specific projects. This will, in turn, serve as the foundation for scheduling similar projects in the future, ensuring better task management and reducing the chances of missing deadlines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When you communicate estimated delivery timelines, it will come from a well-informed position and not an off-handed estimate. The result is more satisfied clientele and more repeat business.</span></p>
<p><b>Improved Billing</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a business owner, you need all the help you can get to ensure you’re billing your customers correctly. Time management software allows you to accurately measure the time spent on a project, allowing for more accurate billing.</span></p>
<p><b>Easier Payroll Management</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How many hours do you spend calculating work hours for payroll purposes? Business owners who boost productivity with time management software enjoy the added advantage of automatically generated timesheets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This doesn’t just save time; it also lowers the risk of disputes, as employees will always receive the right amount of pay even if they work odd hours.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><img class="size-full wp-image-16847 alignleft" src="https://www.archistech.com/files/2024/03/Untitled-design-2024-02-06T142720.630.png" alt="" width="300" height="225" />Microsoft Outlook users have a new security concern. A vulnerability in the platform increases the risk of exposing your password to threat actors when you accept calendar invitations.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Cybersecurity researchers from Varonis Threat Labs uncovered this Microsoft Outlook security flaw in July 2023. Microsoft fixed it with a patch on December 12, 2023. If you haven't implemented this patch, malicious attackers may gain access to your passwords.</span></p>
<p><b>Explaining the Calendar-Dependent Microsoft Outlook Security Flaw</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The latest Microsoft Outlook vulnerability can leak your password hash in one click. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The vulnerability allows attackers to launch offline brute-force attacks (where they test millions of passwords against the hashed passwords from your system) or relay attacks. Either way, the result could be compromised accounts or unauthorized access to critical data.</span></p>
<p><b>How Are Victims Attacked?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This Microsoft Outlook security flaw targets how Outlook handles calendar invites and user interaction throughout the process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In most cases, you must open an iCalendar file (.ics) to accept a calendar invite on Outlook. Accepting the file format is the only way to transfer events or other calendar data to your calendar application.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Threat actors actively exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft Outlook infuse malicious headers into the .ics file, forcing a remote code execution. Successful execution sends them NTLM v2 hashed passwords from the victim's system.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, it only takes one click (which is accepting the calendar invite) for the victim to unwittingly give up access to their passwords.</span></p>
<p><b>How To Protect Yourself From The Flaw</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You can protect yourself from this Microsoft Outlook security flaw in various ways.</span></p>
<p><b>Technical Approaches</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Cyber security experts recommend several technical approaches to avoid NTLM v2 hashed passwords:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Adopting Kerberos authentication in place of NTLM wherever possible</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Blocking outgoing NTLM v2</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Protecting your SMB server from man-in-the-middle attacks</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Non-Technical Approaches</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyday Outlook users can also take steps to avoid security vulnerabilities such as this one. The first option is to stay up to date with security patches.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Microsoft (and other tech giants) constantly monitor threat reports. They publish a security update when the threat level of a vulnerability is high enough to warrant action. Users are now responsible for downloading patches to protect themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Keeping your systems up to date helps keep you safe from threats like the current Microsoft Outlook security flaw.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Secondly, users must be more careful about the calendar invitations they accept. Always verify the sender and any invitation or request details before accepting them. Check for obvious signs of spoofing, such as misspelled names, domains, or email addresses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You should also pay attention to the subject and message body. Are they relevant? Have you shown any interest in such an event recently? If you have any reasons to doubt the invite's authenticity, ignore it.</span></p>

<p><b>What To Know About Adobe Premiere Pro Beta</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The latest version of Premiere Pro software, Adobe Premiere Pro beta, provides groundbreaking audio and video editing improvements. The software is set to be available for all Adobe Creative Cloud subscribers as a standalone application, enhancing the process of creating videos with clear sound and picture capabilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some of the new Premiere elements utilize artificial intelligence to streamline the video editing process without compromising the results. Creators can complete high-quality projects in less time than using other video-editing software. </span></p>
<p><b>Brand-New Features Within the New Version of Premiere Pro</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What sets Adobe Premiere Pro beta apart from other video-editing programs? Its innovative features aim to reduce clicks and edits using the power of artificial intelligence. Below is a breakdown of each new feature and its benefits. </span></p>
<p><b>Interactive Fade Handles</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Make your videos stand out with custom audio transitions. What once took more time in other programs is now seamless in Premiere Pro beta. All you need to do is drag your audio transitions across your main editing timeline, which reduces the total editing time. </span></p>
<p><b>AI-Powered Audio Category Tagging</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Creators can spend a lot of time sifting through audio clips to label them correctly and cut out unnecessary noise. The AI audio tagging feature in Premiere Pro beta eliminates the hassle of manual editing. It automatically runs through all of your audio clips and then identifies and labels the content into the following categories:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Ambient noise</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Music</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Dialogue</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">Sound effects</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The software then lets you access each category of sound in one click. </span></p>
<p><b>User-Friendly Badges and Waveforms</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Visual badges allow you to indicate which clips have effects while editing easily. The audio waveforms use AI to monitor height changes with the clips and boast new color correction features. These improvements ultimately make editing much easier to manage and let you focus on your creativity. </span></p>
<p><b>How Adobe Premiere Pro Beta Benefits Small Businesses</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Running a small business requires you to juggle many tasks against limited resources. You can create effective and high-quality audio or video advertisements by subscribing to the Adobe Creative Cloud. Premiere Pro beta's AI-powered features minimize the time it takes to sort through each clip and add the effects you want. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You can focus on sharing the story you want and quickly create video clips that appear professionally made to share with a wide audience. Investing in this software can save you time and money. </span></p>
<p><b>Improve Your Small Business With Technology Resources</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In addition to Adobe Premiere Pro beta, there are countless pieces of software and technology that can help small business owners increase productivity. Contact qualified industry professionals to learn more about the programs that can benefit your workflow. </span></p>
