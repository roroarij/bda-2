We offer a variety of building emergency radio communication enhancement technologies meant to boost the signal for 2-way portable land mobile radios (LMR) on which first responders rely.<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row equal_height=&#8221;yes&#8221; content_placement=&#8221;middle&#8221; css_animation=&#8221;fadeInRight&#8221; el_class=&#8221;box-overlap image-left&#8221;][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;5850&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221;][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/2&#8243;][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h3><b>Reliable Signal For Positive Outcomes<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>No matter what technology you implement for signal enhancements, it\u2019s vital to have a well-constructed in-building signal infrastructure, especially during times of a natural disaster, terrorist act, fire, or medical emergency. First responders heavily depend on the signal strength of their 2-way radios in order to communicate clearly and quickly with dispatchers and administrators outside of the building, and also to communicate with those in remote areas of the same complex.<\/p>\n<p>Upgrading an in-building emergency radio communication system can reduce avoidable delays between responders and assist the rescuers in a crisis situation where seconds could potentially mean the difference between a disastrous and successful outcome.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row equal_height=&#8221;yes&#8221;][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/3&#8243;][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h3>F.A.Q<\/h3>\n<p>We\u2019ve answered some of the most common questions about first responder communications solutions here, but if you don\u2019t see your question, just ask and we\u2019ll be in touch.[\/vc_column_text][vc_btn title=&#8221;ASK A QUESTION&#8221; link=&#8221;url:%2Fcontact%2F&#8221;][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;2\/3&#8243;][vc_toggle title=&#8221;Who needs ERRS coverage?&#8221; style=&#8221;round&#8221; open=&#8221;true&#8221;]All commercial buildings must provide adequate signal strength for first responders. High-rises, apartment complexes, extended care facilities, universities, warehouses, and performance venues all have applicable regulations.[\/vc_toggle][vc_toggle title=&#8221;When do buildings need to be tested?&#8221; style=&#8221;round&#8221;]If you\u2019re planning construction, ERRS coverage should be part of your budget. New buildings should be tested once completed, with repeat inspections after remodeling or adding on, with annual testing repeats. You might also need to re-test if construction occurs next to your building or local first responder agencies change frequencies.[\/vc_toggle][vc_toggle title=&#8221;What happens if a building fails when tested?&#8221; style=&#8221;round&#8221;]If your building doesn\u2019t provide adequate coverage, we can help you identify state, local, and federal requirements, then design and install the products you need for adequate coverage.[\/vc_toggle][vc_toggle title=&#8221;How do I find out what regulations apply to me?&#8221; style=&#8221;round&#8221;]The National Fire Protection Association, International Fire Code, First Responder Network Authority and International Building Code all provide information on regulations. State and local agencies may have additional requirements.[\/vc_toggle][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Related Solutions<\/h2>\n<div
