However, most enterprise networks will need the advanced level of connectivity support that IBW provides, rather than Wi-Fi alone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As wireless companies continue to bombard building owners with 5G advertisements, building owners are left attempting to make sense of what the best wireless solution is for their building.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">From an engineer\u2019s perspective, deploying IBW is simpler than ever before. For the client, it\u2019s also much easier to gain guidance on what IBW solution would best suit their unique requirements (DAS? Small cell? Single-operator, multi-operator, high-power, low-power, etc), and to receive the support needed to implement and manage the right solution.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Regardless of the IBW solution adopted however, there are typically similar steps involved in deployment \u2013 that both engineers and their clients should be aware of and understand for seamless implementation.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">STEP 1: SCHEDULE A MEETING TO DETERMINE OVERALL REQUIREMENTS FOR YOUR DESIGN<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">With our company, our first step is to meet with you to better understand your needs and discuss the requirements for the WLAN. During this meeting, we will discuss the requirements and capacity for your building, as well as your security needs. If you don\u2019t have all the answers, don\u2019t worry. In fact, many people don\u2019t. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here: to help you understand and guide you through the process.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">STEP 2: WE WILL SURVEY THE SITE<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">For existing buildings, a site survey should be conducted to evaluate the signal quality of the different mobile operators and to identify optimum installation locations for radio remote units and antennas. This will require access to building floor plans and the use of site survey tools that can test for signal quality and RF interference.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A provisional RF design is recommended for buildings that are still under construction. The building construction and design team should prepare a preliminary RF design to be included with the initial building plans. A provisional RF design can provide a best estimation of RF penetration based on the structure, materials and floor plan of the building.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">STEP 3: INSTALLATION AND DEPLOYMENT<\/span><\/h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Our installation engineers are held to the highest standards and are committed to producing a high quality DAS system. We will never compromise the quality of our work, but will always finish on time and on budget.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Having established your blueprint for your DAS project, it then becomes time to put your plan into action and begin installation. Here are the basic steps we will go through for a successful installation.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">End-to-end DAS installation<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Full construction management<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Head-end equipment installation and testing.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">System optimization and acceptance testing.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Macro network optimization.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Public safety compliance and coordination.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Building wireless solutions are always evolving, and are now more affordable, versatile and easier to install than ever before; great news for enterprise environments, who increasingly need to ensure high quality, continuous connectivity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Of course, this is also great news for infrastructure professionals and those who maintain the right wireless training, will be best placed to stay ahead of the curve in an evolving and expanding market.
