			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emergency Responder Radio Communications Systems (ERRCS) are a vital component of public safety communications in buildings and facilities. These systems are designed to ensure that first responders can communicate effectively during emergencies, making them a vital component of any emergency response plan. However, to ensure the safety of occupants and the effectiveness of first responders, it is essential that buildings meet the regulatory requirements related to ERRCS.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and International Fire Code (IFC) are the primary regulatory bodies governing ERRCS.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Police two-way radios are essential pieces of equipment, to protect citizens as well as the officers themselves from harm. Public safety, police, firefighters, EMTs and emergency-response professionals know the essentials of two-way radio use because it’s so central to their work.</span></p>
<h2 class="p2"><span class="s1">What Is An ERRCS?</span></h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">An emergency responder radio communication systems is an extension of the public safety radio network based on RF performance. An ERRCS improves in-building coverage for voice communications, and is beneficial to first responders by reaching poor signal areas affected by factors like Low-E glass, interior/exterior walls, interior clutter, external obstructions, and more.</span></p>
<h2 class="p2"><span class="s1">What Does an ERRCS System Look Like?</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An ERRCS looks much like an Over-the-Air Cellular DAS in some respects: it uses a donor antenna to receive the radio signals from the local first responder network – signals that operate on private frequencies. These signals are then re-amplified in the building at the required locations. This communication system is best for when you need to ensure that first responders can maintain wireless communications within a building structure in emergency situations.</span></p>
<h2 class="p2"><span class="s1">The Answer in Emergency Situations</span></h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The Columbine school shooting in 1999 marked one of the first times where easy access to cell phones played a role in a major emergency. Unfortunately, students could call newscasters, but could not convey accurate information, creating conflicting reports that confused first responders.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>How Cellular Antennas Affect the Power of a Signal Booster System</h2>
<p>Cellular antennas represent two of the three essential pieces of a signal booster system, so you’d better believe they can affect the power and performance of the system. Each antenna adds a different element to the equation and picking the right set of antennas can be almost as important as choosing the right booster.</p>
<p><strong>There are five factors under your control which determine the output power of your signal booster system:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Gain of outdoor antenna</li>
<li>Cable run loss between outdoor antenna and signal amplifier</li>
<li>Gain of signal amplifier</li>
<li>Cable run loss between signal amplifier and indoor antenna</li>
<li>Gain of indoor antenna</li>
</ul>
<p>So, even though the amplifier will do most of the heavy lifting, it’s possible to add some serious kick to your system with the right cellular antennas. This can be especially useful in areas where your signal is weak.</p>
<h2>What an Outdoor Cellular Antenna Does, and How to Use Them</h2>
<p>An outdoor (or donor) cellular antenna captures existing signal on the cellular bandwidths and attaches to a cellular signal booster for amplification. These antennas are usually wideband, with a 4G cellular antenna capturing any signal in its radiation pattern between the 698-2700 MHz range (broken into 698-960 MHz and 1710-2700 MHz ranges, specifically).</p>
<p>Donor antennas are the first major piece of a signal booster system and are usually the most difficult to set up properly. This is due to several factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>They need to be set up in the area with the strongest cell signal for best performance. This is usually on the roof of the building.</li>
<li>Many require precise aiming. This applies solely to directional antennas, with Yagi antennas being easier to aim than LPDAs. They need to be aimed toward a cell tower near you.</li>
<li>They need proper cabling, and that cabling needs to run indoors to your signal amplifier.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first and third steps above apply to all outdoor antennas, but the second will vary depending on your outdoor antenna type.</p>
<h2>Yagi Antennas: The Old Reliable</h2>

</div>
</div>
<p>The Yagi antenna (also known as a Yagi-Uda antenna) was invented in 1926 by Japanese inventors Shintaro Uda and Hidetsugu Yagi. Since then, they have played a major role in RF transmission around the world. Improving cellular signal is one of the most common uses of a Yagi antenna and this article will specifically cover cellular Yagi antennas. Here’s an interesting article covering <a href="https://www.dxzone.com/the-true-story-of-yagi-antenna/">the history of Yagi-Uda antennas</a>. Otherwise, let’s get going.</p>
<h3>What is a Yagi Antenna?</h3>
<p>A Yagi antenna is a directional antenna that <strong>improves radiation in a single direction</strong>, and such radiation can be either transmission or reception of energy, such as cell signal.</p>
<h3>What is a Yagi Antenna Used For?</h3>
<p>Yagi antennas have different purposes. At an industrial level, they can work for radars to detect movement or for ham radio. At a consumer level, they can be used to enhance Over-The-Air television reception and, nowadays, <strong>cellular Yagi antennas can boost cell signal at home or at work</strong> where remote areas struggle to ensure quality in telecommunications. However, we don’t recommend using them to boost cell signal in your vehicle. We will explain why in a moment.</p>
<h3>How Does a Yagi Antenna Work?</h3>
<p>A Yagi antenna works through the interaction of four essential pieces:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Driven Element:</strong> The driven element of a Yagi is the point where the feed line is attached from the transmitter to the Yagi to perform the transfer of power from the transmitter to the antenna.</li>
<li><strong>Director(s):</strong> Used to provide the antenna with directional power and gain.</li>
<li><strong>Line:</strong> The spine of the antenna used to hold the directors and reflectors and connect to the driven element.</li>
<li><strong>Reflector:</strong> Used to reject signal outside its range as well as amplify what’s inside &#8211; think of a mirror reflecting light.</li>
</ol>
<p>These pieces allow Y<strong>agi antennas to achieve higher gain than omnidirectional antennas.</strong></p>
<p>They don’t perform well in a vehicle, as driving or sailing creates a constant change of direction. However, the directional nature of a Yagi makes it ideal for home and commercial installations, as it allows for greater gain and reach.</p>
<h3>Is a Yagi Antenna Directional?</h3>
<p>Yes. To be exact, a Yagi antenna is unidirectional, and that’s the main feature when improving cell signal: it aims to <strong>maximize the reception of signal from a particular carrier</strong> in just one direction.</p>
<h3>How Far Can a Yagi Antenna Reach?</h3>
<p>A typical Yagi is effective up to 5 miles – but generally speaking will work best up to around 3. If you’re seeking to amplify cell signal, Yagi antennas come with either 50 or 75 ohm configurations, depending on the use case of your system (commercial or consumer usage). <strong>Yagi antennas are three times more powerful than omnidirectional antennas</strong> because they are frequency-specific, work with one or two carriers, and can be placed to reach the best possible signal wherever you are.</p>
<h3>How Do I Aim a Yagi Antenna?</h3>
<p>You should aim the outdoor antenna <strong>in the direction that best receives the signal from your carrier</strong> because a Yagi antenna will not receive any signal that is out of the direction they point to. In other words, if your carrier is out of the beam of the antenna, you won’t receive the boost you’re looking for. Thus, we recommend finding your nearest cell tower before pointing your yagi antenna.</p>
<h2>Omnidirectional Antennas: The Simple Setup</h2>
<div class="blog-modern-product-box">

</div>
<p>Omnidirectional (or omni) cellular antennas pull in signal from all directions. Cellular omnidirectional antennas are common sights in low-lying areas, or attached to the sides of commercial buildings. While omnidirectional antennas exist for all sorts of RF, this article will focus on cellular.</p>
<h3>What is an Omnidirectional Antenna Used For?</h3>
<p>Omnidirectional antennas are the most useful for multi-carrier setups and are far easier to install than other outdoor options. They pull in all existing signal in an area. This has several advantages, but also a few disadvantages.</p>
<p>There are three major advantages to omnidirectional antennas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy installation</li>
<li>Will amplify all cell signal in your area, from multiple carriers with different cell towers in multiple locations</li>
<li>Superb in strong signal areas and low-lying valleys</li>
</ul>
<p>However, they also have some disadvantages when compared to Yagi and LPDA antennas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t reach as far as a directional antenna</li>
<li>Don’t give as much gain to your incoming signal as a directional antenna</li>
<li>Susceptible to “signal noise” and can become overwhelmed in extremely busy urban areas</li>
<li>Not optimized for rural areas where distance from the cell tower is the main problem</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also some physical limitations to omnidirectional antennas that warrant bearing in mind.</p>
<p>All that said, omnidirectional antennas work extremely well in strong-to-middling strength signal areas, and, when paired with a powerful enough amplifier, are more than equipped to do a great job.</p>
<h2>Cellular Log-Periodic Dipole Array (LPDA) Antenna: The Highest Power</h2>
<div class="blog-modern-product-box">
<div class="image"><img decoding="async" class="lazyautosizes lazyloaded" src="https://www.wilsonamplifiers.com/product_images/uploaded_images/wilson-lpda-antenna.png" sizes="227px" alt="High Gain LPDA Antenna - 311228" data-sizes="auto" data-src="/product_images/uploaded_images/wilson-lpda-antenna.png" /></div>
<div class="details">High Gain LPDA Antenna &#8211; 311228</p>
<p class="blurb">Powerful directional antenna with up to 13.1 dBi</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Log-periodic antennas are known by many names: LPDA (short for log-periodic dipole array), log-periodic dipole antenna, log-periodic aerial, or just a log-periodic array. They have a simple job: <strong>to operate over a wide band of radio frequencies</strong>. What these frequencies bandwidths are vary based on the type of log periodic antenna you buy.</p>
<p>They’re more common than you might think. You’ve probably noticed log periodic antennas in passing all your life, sitting atop suburban and rural rooftops, poking out on apartment balconies. Traditionally, log periodic antennas have been used for analog television, which was the dominant style until digital eclipsed and replaced it in the recent past. Even still, they remain used in many areas, and, as a quick search for a TV antenna will show you, they continue to dominate that market.</p>
<p>The reason for this is simple: they <strong>have excellent range and can cover a wide range of broadband frequencies</strong>. Their directivity allows them to have a narrower focus than their cousins the Yagi antenna, which <strong>gives them increased power over their brethren</strong>. Properly installed, they will work in fringe areas Yagi&#8217;s just can’t.</p>
<h3>How Do Log Periodic Dipole Array (LDPA) Antennas Work?</h3>
<p>Log periodic antennas (hereafter referred to as ‘LPDA’ or ‘LPDAs’) normally consist of half-wave dipole elements each consisting of a pair of metal rods positioned along a support boom lying along the antenna axis. The spacing of these elements are what allow for the tuning of the frequency range of the LPDA &#8211; meaning, cellular LPDAs are finely tuned in such a way as to pick up cellular frequencies between the 698-2700 MHz frequencies. Other LPDA antennas focus on <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/personal-radio-services-prs-keeping-touch">VHF</a>, <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/public-safety/uhfvhf-bands">UH</a>F, WiFi, <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-opens-6-ghz-band-wi-fi-and-other-unlicensed-uses">and other wavelengths in the high frequency GHz spectrum</a>.</p>
<p>LPDA antennas are contrasted with <a href="https://interferencetechnology.com/emc-antenna-parameters-and-their-relationships/">EMC antennas</a>, which operate electromagnetically, and <a href="https://www.antenna-theory.com/arrays/main.php">array antennas</a>, which are big, complicated arrays of numerous antennas that can both transmit and receive. LPDAs are significantly more diverse in their usage &#8211; they can operate off standard power and can be installed just about anywhere at not too great of a cost.</p>
<p>LPDA antennas <strong>focus on antenna gain</strong> (measured in dBi). While a Yagi or omni antenna focuses on bringing in signal within relatively close environs, the LPDA can work adequately in fringe conditions. This is accomplished with a relatively focused radiation pattern, at a roughly 30-degree beamwidth.</p>
<p>A radiation pattern with such high gain and wide bandwidth is achieved by creating a three-element Yagi antenna. These are called <strong>driven elements</strong>, connected electrically to the feedline. This feedline &#8211; usually coaxial cable, but sometimes twin-lead or ladder line &#8211; zig zags between the dipole elements. Certain LPDAs are known as <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US3355740">log-periodic zig zag antennas</a> because they replace the dipoles with the feedline itself.</p>
<h2>Yagi vs. Omni vs. LPDA: Which Cellular Antenna is Best for Me?</h2>
<p>There are a few major differences between the three major cellular antennas (Yagi, omni, and LPDAs), all of which have been hinted at above.</p>
<h3>How They Are the Same</h3>
<p>Omnidirectional antennas, Yagi antennas, and LPDAs pull in existing cellular signal (5G, 5G E, 4G LTE, and 3G, depending on the bandwidths covered by the antenna). All of them increase the power of the signal upon pulling it in, but the extent to which that happens varies depending on the type.</p>
<h3>How They Differ</h3>
<p>Omni antennas are the standard antenna type. They catch signal <strong>in a 360-degree field, and do not discriminate</strong>. They will seize any cellular signal that exists, whether you want it or not. This is great if you have several cell sites nearby, since you can easily multiple carriers at once. Omni-directional antennas nearly always look like rod shaped cylinders. Think of a radio antenna you might have on your car &#8211; this is an omni antenna.</p>
<p>The main disadvantage of an omni antenna is its power. Due to its 360-degree radiation pattern, both its range and overall dBi gain are lower than directional antennas.</p>
<p>However, this disadvantage comes with some very real perks: <strong>omni antennas are ideal for multi-carrier setups in strong outside signal environments</strong>. Many of our corporate clients prefer omni antennas, because they usually must service multiple carriers (AT&amp;T, Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile, etc.) inside their buildings.</p>
<p>Although it’s plausible for two T-Mobile or any other same-carrier towers to be close enough to each other that the omni-antenna pulls in signal from both, it&#8217;s most likely a rare situation. Depending on the location, you’ll most likely be close to one of each carrier tower (i.e., one AT&amp;T tower, one T-Mobile, one Verizon tower, etc., not two AT&amp;T towers, three T-Mobile towers, one Verizon, etc.).</p>
<p>That’s where an LPDA or Yagi antenna come in. These are more specialized, with Yagi antennas being more general use than LPDAs. Their <strong>directionality allows for longer range and higher gain</strong>, with the LPDA being more directional than the Yagi. This directionality allows for more precise and powerful signal to reach your amplifier.</p>
<p>The <strong>more remote you are, the more directional you’ll want to think</strong>. Conversely, if you’re in an extremely urban area and are bombarded with irrelevant signal, becoming more directional can help with that, too.</p>
<h3>Which Outdoor Antenna Gives the Highest Gain?</h3>
<p><strong>Log-periodic dipole array (LPDA) antennas</strong> give the highest gain in almost every situation. LPDA antennas have longer range and higher gain than Yagi and omnidirectional antennas <strong>but are harder to aim and very directional</strong>. However, these are far and away your <strong>best option in rural or weak signal areas</strong>.</p>
<h2>What an Indoor Cellular Antenna Does, and How to Use Them</h2>
<p>Indoor cellular antennas are the piece which <strong>broadcasts the cellular signal captured by outdoor antennas in buildings</strong>. Like outdoor antennas, they come in two varieties: panel and dome.</p>
<p>Panel and dome antennas get their name from their shape, which plays a role in how they operate. The dome shape allows the antenna to broadcast the boosted signal in every direction, making it a type of omni-directional antenna. A panel antenna only broadcasts signals in one direction, making it a directional antenna.</p>
<p>These need to be <strong>placed where you most desire signal</strong>. The closer you are to the radiation pattern of the indoor antenna, the stronger your signal will be. This directly affects the coverage area of your signal booster system.</p>
<h2>Panel Antennas: Versatility and Power</h2>
<div class="blog-modern-product-box">
<div class="image"><img decoding="async" class="lazyautosizes lazyloaded" src="https://www.wilsonamplifiers.com/product_images/uploaded_images/wilson-indoor-panel-antenna.png" sizes="206px" alt="Wilson Panel Antenna - 311135" data-sizes="auto" data-src="/product_images/uploaded_images/wilson-indoor-panel-antenna.png" /></div>
<div class="details">Panel Antenna &#8211; 311135</p>
<p class="blurb">Popular in-building directional antenna with up to 10.6 dBi</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The majority of weBoost signal booster kits by RFeCommunications use panel antennas. They are wall-mounted and send signals in a directional cone ranging from 45 to 70 degrees. Having such a narrow focus allows for stronger signal at the source (i.e. the closer to the panel antenna, the better the signal).</p>
<p>On average, they give 75 feet of coverage. This varies depending on how strong the outside signal is. If there is strong signal outside, there will be more coverage. Weak signal areas will get less.</p>
<p>The reason why panel antennas are generally recommended first is because of inside interference, and their higher gain. Building materials such as metal, concrete, and energy-efficient barriers can disrupt signals from penetrating the building. Once inside with the help of a signal booster, dense walls and other RF-disrupting material (metal, glass, sheetrock, etc.) can equally disturb the signal coming from the inside antenna.</p>
<p>With a panel antenna, you’re able to focus the signal within a specific location in your home or commercial building that needs better signal, such as your living room, home office, or conference room. As a result, the signal being broadcasted in that area will face minimal interference. Every device in that room will receive better signal and faster data first before the signal spreads to lower priority areas.</p>
<p>To improve the signal in the rooms with limited to nonexistent coverage, the panel antenna can be installed right side up or upside down on a wall, and in some cases on a high ceiling. If installed on the ceiling, due to its beamwidth and strength, it can also improve the signal in the lower levels of your house or commercial building. However, the signal won’t be as strong in the lower levels as it is in the room where the antenna is located because the building materials it must travel through interferes with the signal’s strength.</p>
<h2>Dome Antennas: Convenience and Coverage</h2>
<div class="blog-modern-product-box">

<p class="blurb">Powerful &amp; discreet in-building omni with up to 7 dBi</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Dome antennas are ceiling-mounted and broadcast amplified signal 360 degrees horizontally &#8211; think of its broadcasting beam as half a sphere. This provides a wide horizontal spread of coverage to deliver equal signal in every direction.</p>
<p>Depending on your outside signal strength, on average you’ll get about 50 feet of coverage with a dome antenna. Areas with poor cellular service will probably receive much less coverage.</p>
<p>When considering a dome antenna, keep in mind that you’ll need access to a crawl space or attic for proper installation. Thus, they tend to be better for commercial use, one-story homes, or multi-level homes with drop ceilings.</p>
<p>When installed under perfect conditions, meaning low ceilings and zero to minimal inside interference, dome antennas are phenomenal at broadcasting improved 3G, 4G LTE, and 5G signals in large areas.</p>
<p>However, if you have high ceilings (usually 20-30 feet or higher) and thick or numerous walls, then a dome antenna isn’t be recommended, since the signal will weaken the further it travels.</p>
<h2>Dome and Panel Antenna Gain</h2>
<p>Every type of antenna has a certain amount of gain associated with them, measured in dB (decibels). Simply put, gain represents an <a href="https://www.jpole-antenna.com/2014/03/28/antenna-gain-explained/">antenna’s ability to direct the signal</a> it’s broadcasting and how far the signal can travel. Antennas with high gain usually mean they are more directional, which results in more reach. On the other hand, lower gain antennas tend to be the opposite. We’ve covered this in the outdoor antenna section.</p>
<p>Panel antennas, since they are directional, will have more gain and reach than a dome antenna. Our regular dome antennas feature up to +5.1 dB of gain and the low-profile dome antennas feature up to +6 or +7 dB of gain, while the panel antennas tend to feature up to +7.6 dB or up to +10.6 dB of gain.</p>
<p>If you live in an area with weak signal, a higher gain antenna will probably be your best option. This will allow the broadcasted signal to be a tad bit stronger and travel a tad bit further in your home or commercial building than it would with a dome antenna.</p>
<h2>Panel vs. Dome: Which Should I Get?</h2>
<p>A good rule of thumb when trying to choose between dome and panel antennas is to think about:</p>
<ul>
<li>The shape of the area in which you want to boost the signal</li>
<li>What inside interference exists in the area</li>
<li>How much of a priority is coverage in that area</li>
</ul>
<p>Do you have <strong>lots of inside interference</strong> &#8211; thick walls, metal, and glass &#8211; around your home or building? Is there a specific area you want priority service, such as a closed off room or corridor? If you answered yes to any of those questions, then <strong>go with a panel antenna</strong>.</p>
<p>Do you have <strong>open spaces</strong> with virtually no walls, thin walls, or minimal inside interference? Do you want to broadcast an equal amount of signal throughout your home or building? Do you have low ceilings and access to a crawl space or attic? If yes, then <strong>go with a dome antenna</strong>.</p>
<p>Depending on your outside signal strength and the size of your building, it’s entirely possible one antenna will not be enough to provide the coverage you want, especially in multi-level residential or commercial buildings. To maximize your coverage area, you may want to consider getting splitters and a combination of panel and dome antennas. If you decide to purchase additional antennas, make sure their impedance rating of 50 Ohms or 75 Ohms matches that of your signal booster, otherwise, you&#8217;ll need additional connectors and adapters and have more loss.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Other Indoor Antenna Types</h2>
<p>Dome and panel antennas are not the only types of indoor antennas available; they are just the most common. There are two other types of indoor antennas that can be paired with booster systems designed to cover one to two rooms, such as the weBoost Home Studio and the weBoost Home Room.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Terminal Antennas or Whip Antennas</strong> attach directly to the signal amplifier &#8211; similar to a WiFi router’s rubber ducky antenna. They’re omni-directional just like the dome antenna but not as powerful.</li>
<li><strong>Desktop Antennas</strong> have a nice, discreet design. They are omni-directional and can be placed on any flat surface for better signal wherever you need it most. They can even be used in vehicles!</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Avoid Signal Oscillation Between Cellular Antennas</h2>
<p>Oscillation is one of the most common answers to the question: “Why doesn’t my cell signal booster work?”</p>
<p>It’s a feedback loop between your two antennas, caused by them <strong>being installed too close together</strong>.</p>
<p>Think of a speaker and a microphone. When you bring the microphone too close to a speaker, an unpleasant humming sound is created, with the screech getting louder and louder the closer they are together. This is oscillation, and it occurs with your antennas, too.</p>
<p>This is a problem that’s fixed by increasing the distance between the three components of your signal booster. Your antennas need to be <strong>at least 50 feet apart horizontally, or 20 feet vertically</strong> in order to prevent oscillation. Unfortunately, if you’ve set up your antennas for your ideal setup, you may have to move one or both antennas to a slightly less optimal position for you to get rid of the oscillation. However, this is balanced by the fact that the booster’s performance will dramatically increase, and that should more than make up for the fact that the broadcast antenna might not always be in the perfect position.</p>
<h2>How to Prevent Signal Booster Overload</h2>
<p>Most consumer boosters have the possibility of overload. If you’ve bought a cheaper signal booster, have fantastic outdoor signal but terrible indoor signal, and use high-gain antennas and cable, you might be <strong>delivering too much signal to your booster, and overloading it</strong>. This causes the booster to shut down completely, in order to save itself.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this is very easy to fix, with multiple options as to how you go about it.</p>
<p>If you want to throw money at the problem and deal with it easily, we sell attenuators to slightly decrease the amount of signal you’re bringing in and prevent overload. There are also commercial-grade boosters that automatically attenuate the signal you’re receiving, but they come with a rather high price tag and are overkill for most home setups.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to spend any more money, you’ll need to place your antenna differently. There are two options for this: placing it in a spot with weaker signal than where you have it or turning it away from a signal that’s too strong, thereby attenuating the signal. This is the easiest, cheapest method, if you don’t mind going on the roof again.</p>
<h2>What is a Vehicle Cellular Antenna, and How Do I Use Them?</h2>
<p>Vehicle antennas can be thought of as smaller, portable versions of indoor and outdoor antennas. The biggest difference is that every outdoor vehicle antenna is omnidirectional, since vehicles are prone to moving about and will need to constantly broadcast and downlink cellular signal. Thus, the difference between vehicle outdoor antennas is simply how large and powerful the antennas are.</p>

<p>Magnet mount antennas should need no introduction – they&#8217;re simply little antennas you <strong>mount magnetically to the frame of a vehicle</strong>. They provide minimal gain but have far and away the simplest installation, unless you have an aluminum frame. A magnet mount antenna can be used on any vehicle viably, but struggle at times to cover larger interiors.</p>
<p>The most common magnet mount antenna is the 4” magnet mount, which comes standard in vehicle signal booster kits. There are also <strong>12” magnet mounts, which provide a bit more gain</strong> across the standard cellular bandwidths. These are inexpensive upgrades and should be considered by anyone who is having issues covering the cabin of their vehicle with a powerful vehicle booster like the weBoost Drive Reach.</p>
<h2>Over-the-Road (OTR) Antennas: For Trucks and Large Cabins</h2>
<div class="blog-modern-product-box">
<div class="image"><img decoding="async" class="lazyautosizes lazyloaded" src="https://www.wilsonamplifiers.com/product_images/uploaded_images/wilson-drive-rv-antenna.png" sizes="195px" alt="Wilson Drive OTR Antenna - 311229" data-sizes="auto" data-src="/product_images/uploaded_images/wilson-drive-rv-antenna.png" /></div>
<div class="details">Drive OTR Antenna &#8211; 311229</p>
<p class="blurb">Rugged hard-mount antenna for trucks, RVs, and SUVs with up to 4.3 dBi</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>An Over-the-Road Antenna is a mounted antenna designed <strong>for semi-trucks and RVs, but can be used in pickup trucks or large SUVs</strong>. These are much larger and more powerful than a magnet mount, but are more challenging to install. If you spend lots of time on the road, or have a large cabin or interior, an OTR antenna can be a very valuable investment.</p>
<p>There isn’t too much to go into here: an <strong>OTR is a more powerful omnidirectional vehicle antenna</strong>. If your vehicle is large enough to warrant it, you spend considerable time in your vehicle outside of urban areas, or you’re not getting the boost you need from a magnet mount and a powerful mobile booster, then an OTR will help you.</p>
<h2>NMO Antennas: Permanent Installations for Commercial Fleet Vehicles</h2>
<div class="blog-modern-product-box">
<div class="image"><img decoding="async" class="lazyautosizes lazyloaded" src="https://www.wilsonamplifiers.com/product_images/uploaded_images/wilson-4g-nmo-antenna.png" sizes="212px" alt="Wilson NMO Antenna - 314405" data-sizes="auto" data-src="/product_images/uploaded_images/wilson-4g-nmo-antenna.png" /></div>

<p class="blurb">Best external antenna for fleet vehicles with up to 3.2 dBi</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>“NMO” (New Motorola Mount – yes, really) antennas are a bit of an odd duck in the vehicle space. For cellular purposes, they’re <strong>permanently installed in a fleet vehicle</strong> – whether that be a taxicab, delivery van, or semi-truck &#8211; in order to get increased gain over a magnet mount. These are very valuable for businesses which rely heavily on their fleets.</p>

<h2>Magnet Mount vs. OTR vs. NMO: Which Cellular Antenna is Best for My Vehicle?</h2>
<p>This is a simpler choice than with building antennas.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cars:</strong> 4” magnet mounts are sufficient for most cars. Upgrade: 12” magnet mount</li>
<li><strong>SUVs:</strong> 4” magnet mounts work on most SUVs. Upgrade: 12” magnet mount or OTR</li>
<li><strong>Pickup:</strong> 4” magnet mounts work on most pickups. Upgrade: 12” magnet mount or OTR</li>
<li><strong>RVs:</strong> OTR. 4” magnet mount will work in a pinch.</li>
<li><strong>Semi-trucks:</strong> OTR. 12” magnet mount will work in a pinch.</li>
<li><strong>Fleet vehicles of any type:</strong> NMO. OTRs will work as an alternative</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other Types of Vehicle Cellular Antennas</h2>
<p>There are a few other types of vehicle antennas to go over, but their use cases are less complex:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Marine antennas</strong> are large, waterproof antennas designed to be used aboard&#8230;well, marine vehicles. They can be used to ensure cellular coverage of a boat’s cabin up to several miles offshore. Get one of these if you have a boat.</li>
<li><strong>Low-profile antennas</strong> are the most common type of interior antenna for vehicles, being packaged in nearly every multi-user kit. They resemble candy bars and are designed not to stand out and transmit directionally.</li>
<li><strong>Desktop Antennas</strong> are small interior antennas best used in RVs or vehicles with extremely large cabins. They are trickier to place than low-profile antennas but provide slightly higher gain.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3>Is Higher dBi Better for Antennas?</h3>
<p>In general, yes. However, there are many reasons you might consider dropping a few dBi levels: convenience of installation, getting multiple carriers in your network, overall cost, and whether your booster is likely to overload from too much incoming signal.</p>
<h3>I’ve Heard Some Talk About 5G Cellular Antennas. What’s the Difference Between them and a 4G Cellular Antenna?</h3>
<p>A “5G” antenna usually adds the T-Mobile 5G band, which brings its range to 600-2700 MHz. These do nothing for Verizon or AT&amp;T 5G, which are broadcast on millimeter wave and not cellular bands. Thus, they can be used with 5G-compatible signal boosters on the T-Mobile 5G network.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, cell phone users expect high-quality indoor coverage. Whether in restaurants, malls, hotels, hospitals, schools, or other areas, cell phone users do not expect dropped calls and poor reception. But how can indoor coverage be improved, and why is it essential, especially for first responders? Keep reading to learn more.</p>
<h3>What is Indoor Coverage?</h3>
<p>Indoor coverage involves providing coverage of places that are not covered by traditional networks. Some of these places include basements and buildings made of thick materials.</p>
<h3>What Causes Poor Indoor Coverage?</h3>
<p>A variety of factors can cause poor indoor coverage. Some of the common ones include:</p>
<h3>Construction Materials</h3>
<p>Modern construction materials such as concrete, metal, concrete, bricks, and even energy-efficient glass can negatively impact indoor coverage because cellular signals find it difficult to pass through these materials.</p>
<h3>Distance</h3>
<p>To receive good reception, you need to be close to a cell phone tower. The further you are from a cell phone tower, the poorer your signal is likely to be.</p>
<h3>Topography</h3>
<p>While natural features such as mountains and hills provide breathtaking views, they can obstruct cell phone signals and reduce indoor coverage.</p>
<h3>Frequencies</h3>
<p>Higher frequencies, such as 4G and 5G, offer greater bandwidth. As a result, they can allow you to send more data in less time than lower frequencies. Unfortunately, they are less penetrative compared to lower frequencies like 2G and 3G.</p>
<h3>How Poor Indoor Coverage Affects Public Safety</h3>
<p>Many people have ditched traditional landlines in favor of cell phones. As a result, today, it is estimated that 80% of indoor calls are made from cell phones. Several of these calls are distress calls. Distress calls need to go through without fail, making good indoor coverage a public safety concern.</p>
<p>Ideally, if someone places a distress call, first responders need to receive the call promptly to act immediately. Unfortunately, because indoor coverage is poor in many buildings, sometimes first responders cannot respond quickly enough.</p>
<p>So how can first responder communications be improved? Here are some ways to improve it:</p>
<h3>First Responder Distributed Antenna Systems (DAS)</h3>
<p>A <a href="http://rfeconnect.com/use-cases/first-responders/">first responder DAS</a> is simply a network of independent antennas linked to the same source. Together, they can improve indoor coverage within an area such as a building with several floors or a stadium. First responder DAS is typically ideal for large areas such as tall buildings.</p>
<h3>Pros of First Responder DAS</h3>
<p><strong>Supports Many Users: </strong> First responder DAS guarantees quality reception and excellent connectivity even if the number of users is high.</p>
<p><strong>Cost-Effective: </strong> Commercial DAS utilizes several low power networks instead of one high power one.</p>
<h3>First Responder Cellular Boosters</h3>
<p>Like DAS, commercial cell boosters can also improve indoor coverage and enhance public safety. Once they detect a signal in an area, they amplify it and transmit the amplified signal throughout the area.</p>
<h3>Pros of First Responder Cellular Boosters</h3>
<p><strong>Inexpensive: </strong> They tend to be cheaper to implement than DAS networks.</p>
<p><strong>Enhance Signal Strength: </strong> They can improve signal strength and enable first responders to respond quickly to emergencies.</p>
<p>Emergencies are inevitable. When they do strike, first responders need to respond to them fast. By implementing the above technologies, you can guarantee the safety of the people inside your premises and aid first responders.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the hustle and bustle of today’s fast moving world, technology is constantly being upgraded. It&#8217;s no surprise that it&#8217;s constantly changing every aspect of our lives. In the healthcare field, technology continues to play an important role.</p>
<p>Technology has allowed cures to be found for many illnesses and allowed changes to be made in treatment and care. It has also greatly improved communication in the healthcare industry and in first responder communications.</p>
<p>Here are several ways technology has improved communication in healthcare:</p>
<h3>Easily Accessible Medical Records</h3>
<p>When someone is sick at home, one of the first things they’re likely to do is go to the Internet and look up their symptoms. While this can be beneficial for common, easily treated illnesses, in some cases it can cause some people to think they’re sicker than they actually are. Nonetheless, technology has allowed everyday people to have access to medical information via the Internet so they can at least get some idea of what might be wrong with them or a family member.</p>
<h3>Social Media</h3>
<p>These days, many clinics and hospitals have social media profiles to expand their audience and allow people an easy way to contact them. Through social media, clinics and physicians can educate people on treatments for common illnesses, they can offer advice and they can offer information that’s specific to their clinic or their practice. As an added bonus, patients can leave feedback on a doctor or a facility, which can help others as they make decisions about their health.</p>
<h3>Fast Results</h3>
<p>In older times, patients were often left waiting weeks or even months for medical test results. Nowadays, many clinics and hospitals around the United States offer web portals to patients, which allows them to access test results or other personal information in a matter of hours of days. This helps put patients at ease and allows them to contact their doctors if they need to follow up.</p>
<h3>Better Treatments and Equipment</h3>
<p>As technology continues to evolve, the benefits of upgrades in technology continue to grow. While improved healthcare is perhaps the biggest benefit to come from technology, there have been other benefits as well.</p>
<p>One benefit is better equipment. Upgrades in technology have allowed doctors to provide better care with the newest in equipment and therefore communicate better with patients. Better equipment has led to better treatments, which has in turn, increased the quality of life among many patients who are battling long term illnesses.</p>
<p>With longer life expectancy and better communication between doctors and patients has helped to decrease the fear that some have felt about particular illnesses in the past. Better treatments have also allowed for research to be sped up and allowed the focus of research to be narrowed so that scientists can better hone in on solving previously unsolvable medical mysteries. Better treatments have also led to improvements in the way procedures are performed. Procedures that used to take days or weeks to recover from can now be performed in a matter of hours with faster recovery times.</p>
<p>Ultimately, all of it has resulted in better medical treatments, better communication, and happier patients.</p>
<h3>Fewer Errors</h3>
<p>Thanks to electronic prescribing, prescription errors are greatly reduced and clinicians can send prescriptions directly to a pharmacy. In this way patients can get the correct prescriptions they need from just about any pharmacy in their local area. It’s yet another way that improved communication and evolving technology has helped improve patient safety.</p>
<h3>Better Doctor-Patient Relationships</h3>
<p>With faster access to patient records, doctors can provide better knowledge about a patient’s care. With a more complete picture of their health, patients can feel more comfortable with their doctor and have better communication and a better relationship with them.</p>
<p>Another way technology has improved communication between patients and doctors is through the use of telehealth or telemedicine. It’s allowed a doctor visit to be reimagined as a house call without travel and provides numerous benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>It reaches more patients, especially those living in rural areas.</li>
<li>It cuts costs for patients, especially those who may have to spend money on travel, parking and even childcare for a hospital visit.</li>
<li>It improves the quality of health care because it offers improvements in treatment and service delivery. Since they can get a diagnosis from the comfort of home, telehealth also helps divert unnecessary ER visits.</li>
<li>Patients are ultimately more satisfied with the service they receive because they get one-on-one time with their doctor and feel like they’re really being listened to.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Improved Communication For First Responders</h3>
<p>First responders deal with a lot on the job and it’s important that they’re able to communicate effectively and in a timely manner. On the flip side, patients in need, need to be able to reach first responders in times of emergency. In fact, an estimated 240 million calls are made to 911 in the U.S. annually and at least 80% of those are made from wireless devices.</p>
<p>One of the biggest ways that <a href="http://rfeconnect.com">first responder communications</a> have been improved is through the use of commercial Distributed Antenna Systems or commercial DAS. A DAS system is a network of antennas connected to a transport medium that provides wireless services within a home or within a business.</p>
<p>DAS improves first responder communications in many ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bandwidth can be greatly improved, especially by adding antennas in cell towers, which allows first responders to have service over a greater area.</li>
<li>It improves customer satisfaction because there are fewer dropped calls, so when someone calls 911 for help, they know they’re going to get through.</li>
<li>It improves the overall speed of communication, whether it’s between patients and first responders or between first responders and a hospital.</li>
<li>It offers better first responder wireless services because they have internet connectivity in a single area through multiple service carriers.</li>
</ul>
<p>First responder communications are greatly improved by DAS, but in many areas a public safety DAS is a requirement from the National Fire Protection Association.</p>
<p>Imagine for example that a business has a devastating fire break out and calls 911. Once first responders are on the scene, they rely on radio communication to talk to other responders in the building and those outside the building too. In emergency situations like fires and accidents, effective first responder communications are paramount, especially when time is of the essence.</p>
<p>Responding to emergency situations highlights the importance of first responder wireless solutions. If there’s an injury during emergency response or a team needs backup, responders need to be able to reach out for help and know that their equipment is going to work. Thankfully, many wireless companies offer commercial wireless solutions that allow first responders to do their jobs, become more effective, and have more success at keeping people safe.</p>
<h3>Rely on RFeCommunications</h3>
<p>There’s little doubt that effective communication in healthcare is important. It&#8217;s up to the first responders to help keep people safe. When a person is sick, they automatically want to know what’s wrong with them and what they need to do to feel better. With improved technology and communication, patients can get the answers they need and quickly. Whether it’s in first responder communications, telehealth appointments, or even faster access to medical records or both doctors and patients, technology has greater improved communication in healthcare and will continue to do so well into the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">To obtain a prerequisite for an occupancy permit, there are numerous jurisdictions that require NFP or IFC-compliant public safety and emergency responder coverage (ERRC) even as a building owner, general contractor, or a construction project manager. Your building may require a certain variation of a public safety coverage solution (ERRCS) but comprehending the attributes of how coverage is tested and how it may be improved is complex because it changes drastically from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">To help guide you in choosing the correct integrator for testing and possibly installing a public safety DAS or BDA system, understanding precisely what you require and the differentiation in code requirements continue reading this article for further information. </span></p>
<h2>Public Safety Coverages That Your Local Jurisdiction Requires</h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Depending on what state you are located in, national, state, and local fire codes require all new buildings to provide sufficient indoor radio coverage for first responders set by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), your state and the local jurisdictions. Codes and local ordinances making in-building coverage mandatory have been enacted in approximately every city and county in the U.S.A.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Communication must be maintained by first responders during an emergency situation throughout a building or piece of property. It is an absolute necessity that their communication devices continually transmit even in hard-to-reach areas such as basements, stairwells, elevators, and shielded or thick-walled areas. A situation where their radios seize to work cannot happen whether they are responding to a medical emergency, a fire, or a domestic threat. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">First responders need this level of in-building coverage and it is a requirement that you cannot pass by. Each building is mandated to meet a particular level of first responder communication reliability in order to receive a certificate for occupancy in which the building owner/operator is required to test their building and if need be install a system that is up to code.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Suggested ordinances written by these organizations that influence your local jurisdiction and coding requirements are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA)</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">International Code Council (ICC)</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">International Fire Code (IFC)</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">International Building Code (IBC)</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Every jurisdiction has different regulations due to there being no consolidated set of rules at the federal level. For this reason, make sure you are able to understand your local codes! </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">To govern public safety communications a few larger cities have created their own codes but many smaller communities and cities do not draft their own codes, instead, IFC and NFPA speech is endorsed. Overall, what dictates the codes your building must meet is your relevant local authority, and the location of your building. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Further Information: New construction and older buildings alike must comply with these codes &#8211; having an older building does not necessarily mean it is grandfathered in.</span></p>
<h3>Quick Overview: NFPA 72 and IFC Requirements</h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The most commonly used standards by local authorities are NFPA and IFC. Your building including all installed public safety DAS must meet all required standards to pass inspection. It is extremely vital that you understand these requirements. </span></p>
<h2>Most Important/Common Requirements</h2>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Antenna Isolation:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Antenna isolation must be 15 dB higher than the gain of the amplifier NFPA states.</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Battery Backup:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Any equipment that supports the public safety radio system must function for up to 24 hours on a backup battery.</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Concrete Structures &amp; Underground Garages:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> A Public Safety “Distributed Antenna System” (DAS) also referred to as a Public Safety “Bi-Directional Amplifiers” (BDAs) or Public Safety “Repeaters” is a required amplification system. The public safety system must pass 3 types of tests which include: acceptance tests under the observation of the authority in your jurisdiction (AHJ) , annual system performance/battery backup tests, and commissioning tests performed by the building owner. The installation must be done by an FCC-certified technician in most jurisdictions and in other cases, an OSHA safety certified engineer will have to complete the installation.</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Coverage Testing:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Typically, coverage is tested according to a &#8220;20 grid&#8221; or &#8220;40 grid&#8221; process in which each individual floor of a building is divided into 20 or 40 segments. A public safety radio tests each segment to verify that there is connectivity throughout the building and that the signal will meet the minimum downlink/uplink requirements.</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Equipment Enclosures:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> All equipment that supports the public safety network must be housed in a NEMA-4 compliant enclosure specified by the NFPA and IFC.</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Fire Ratings:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> A two-hour fire rating must be met when cables are connecting public safety electronic equipment.</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Minimum Signal Strength:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> A minimum signal strength of -95 dBm is required for sufficient coverage stated by the NFPA and IFC.</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Wireless Coverage:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> Designated areas established by your local fire department must have at least 99% coverage which is extremely important according to the NFPA.</span></p>
