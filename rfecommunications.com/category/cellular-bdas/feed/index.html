			<p>In today’s fast-paced business environment, reliable cellular communication is critical to the success of any commercial building. However, many commercial buildings suffer from poor cellular connection due to weak or nonexistent signals. This is where Bi-Directional Amplifier (BDA) systems come in. In this post, we&#8217;ll explain how BDA systems work and the benefits they can offer to commercial buildings&#8217; cellular connection.</p>

			<h2>How BDA Systems Work</h2>
<p>BDA systems work by capturing weak cellular signals from outside the building, amplifying them, and then rebroadcasting them inside the building. BDA systems can use multiple antennas, each building is designed with its own unique layout and that will vary on how many antennas your building will need. The antennas are connected by a coaxial cable, which carries the amplified signal from the BDA to the internal antenna. BDA systems are designed to work with specific frequencies, such as those used by cell phone carriers. This allows them to capture and amplify only the signals that are relevant to cellular communication. By amplifying these signals, BDA systems can provide improved cellular coverage throughout the building, even in areas where the signal may have been weak or non-existent.</p>

			<h2>Benefits of BDA Systems</h2>
<ol class="p-rich_text_list p-rich_text_list__ordered" data-stringify-type="ordered-list" data-indent="0" data-border="0">
<li data-stringify-indent="0" data-stringify-border="0">Safety: The primary benefit of a BDA system is safety. Without improved cellular coverage you may not be able to call out incase of an emergency.</li>
<li data-stringify-indent="0" data-stringify-border="0">Improved Cellular Coverage: This means that employees, customers, and visitors can make and receive calls, send and receive texts, and access the internet from their cellular devices without any interruptions.</li>
<li data-stringify-indent="0" data-stringify-border="0">Increased Connectivity: Employees can work more efficiently when they don’t have to worry about dropped calls or slow internet speeds. Customers can have a more enjoyable experience in stores, hotels, or other commercial buildings when they have reliable cellular coverage this also allows everyone to be able to tag your location for social media while on site.</li>
<li data-stringify-indent="0" data-stringify-border="0">Compliance with Building Codes: In some areas, local building codes require commercial buildings to provide reliable cellular coverage. By installing a BDA system, commercial building owners can ensure they are meeting these requirements and avoid potential fines or legal issues.</li>
<li data-stringify-indent="0" data-stringify-border="0">Cost Savings: When cellular coverage is weak or nonexistent, employees may resort to using alternative methods of communication, such as landlines or Wi-Fi calling. This can lead to increased costs for the commercial building owner, as well as decreased productivity for the employee. By providing reliable cellular coverage, commercial building owners can avoid these additional costs and maintain the productivity of their employees.</li>
