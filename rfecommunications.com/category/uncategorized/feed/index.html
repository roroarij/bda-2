										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the first thing visitors do when they enter a building is search for the Wi-Fi and then ask for the password. Once they are connected, they expect lightning-fast and stable Wi-Fi. Unfortunately, this is not the case in several buildings. It is estimated that over 72% of people experience slow download speeds indoors. Worse still, they experience dropped calls too.</p>
<p>Your business cannot afford to provide an awful communication experience to clients. Why? Poor connectivity can reduce the foot traffic your business gets resulting in losses. Additionally, displeased clients may give your business poor reviews and ruin your business’s reputation. These are things you certainly want to avoid. Want to give your customers seamless communications when they visit your premises? Here are some solutions worth considering.</p>
<h3>1. Commercial Cell Boosters</h3>
<p>Some buildings have relatively strong cellular signals outside and weak signals inside. If the building where your business is located is like this, then you can benefit from a commercial cell booster installation.</p>
<p>Commercial cell boosters can help boost the signal in your vicinity, thus improving calls and internet connectivity. And if your business occupies a large area, do not worry. Commercial cell boosters can work on large commercial properties that occupy up to 100,000 square feet and beyond. What’s more, they are built to support hundreds of users who need reliable and fast connectivity.</p>
<h3>2. Commercial DAS</h3>
<p>A Distributed Antenna System (DAS) consists of interconnected antennas installed throughout a building to improve voice and internet connectivity for users inside the building. The antennas usually have two main parts: a signal source and a distribution system. The signal source transmits the signal into the <a href="http://rfeconnect.com/use-cases/commercial-cell-boosters/">commercial das</a> system. Meanwhile, the distribution system distributes the signal throughout the building.</p>
<p>If the Wi-Fi or cellular reception in your building is poor, you should consider getting a commercial DAS installed. It can resolve common problems experienced inside buildings, such as dropped calls and poor download speeds.</p>
<p>What’s more, a commercial DAS can extend the battery life of cell phones. Poor signals usually drain battery life. A commercial DAS strengthens weak signals. Thus it can prolong battery life. Whether you’re looking to boost signal strength in a hotel, airport, hospital, bank, or college, a commercial DAS can be used in a variety of settings.</p>
<h3>3. First Responder Communications</h3>
<p>When disaster strikes, first responders need to communicate with the people at the scene of the disaster promptly. Often, first responders usually use cell phones to communicate. While dropped calls happen from time to time, in emergencies, the consequences can be dire. Thus, if you want to improve the safety of your building during emergencies, you should consider investing in first responder cellular boosters and a first responder DAS. Both can enable first responders to communicate clearly during emergencies.</p>
<h3>Keep Your Clients Happy</h3>
<p>Seamless communication can ensure your business attracts and retains clients and avoids unfavorable reviews. Plus, it can enhance the safety of your building. If you are a business owner, you cannot afford to take communications for granted. Invest in solutions such as commercial cell boosters to improve the cellular reception inside your building.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to protecting the public, first responders rely on wireless communications to stay in contact with one another. However, standard wireless communication networks aren&#8217;t enough for first responders who rely on those communications to keep the public, and each other, safe during dangerous situations. More than 72% of people who make phone calls indoors experience dropped calls and slow download speeds. Consider what could happen in the event that a wireless network drops a 9-1-1 call in the middle of an emergency.</p>
<p>Emergency responder radio coverage (ERRC) systems ensure that first responders are able to rely on their handheld radio communications to stay in touch to provide care to the public. ERRCs enhance first responder communications, allowing important information to be transmitted back to a management location to coordinate appropriate emergency response. But how exactly do ERRCs work? And what makes them different from standard wireless communication networks? Here, we&#8217;ll take a look at the most frequently asked questions about first responder communications and ERRCs.</p>
<h3>How do ERRCs work?</h3>
<p>Local, state, and federal law requires new and existing commercial buildings to provide dependable wireless technologies that boost the signal for two-way portable land mobile radios (LMR), which first responders rely on. To be compliant with state and federal guidelines, an ERRC system needs to penetrate all areas of a commercial building. This includes areas of the building that are especially difficult for traditional wireless networks to get a signal in such as a basement, stairwell, or shielded area. To ensure these areas receive a signal, a distributed antenna system (DAS) needs to be installed. A DAS system includes a donor antenna, a bi-directional amplifier (BDA), and an in-building antenna.</p>
<h3>Does every commercial property need an ERRC system installed?</h3>
<p>Yes, both new and existing commercial buildings are required to provide ERRC system coverage for first responders to remain compliant with local, state, and federal law. Commercial properties that are undergoing major renovations are also required to support ERRC systems. Each commercial property needs to be tested to verify that first responder communications work in any location on and inside the building.</p>
<h3>When should a commercial property&#8217;s ERRC system be tested?</h3>
<p>A new ERRC system ought to be tested twice. The first time the system should be tested is when the structure of the building has been complete and all windows and doors are sufficiently installed. The second time the ERRC system test should be conducted is after a remodel, tenant improvement, or addition has been made to the building. This is because these new additions can affect the radio signal available inside the commercial property. Because of this, it&#8217;s essential that the building be retested after any additions, remodels, or renovations are completed.</p>
<p>A test on your ERRC system is conducted using professional-grade RF spectrum analyzers Using a specified grid pattern, these analyzers are used to measure the signal strength inside and throughout your building. The test results for your ERRC system are compiled in a report and then sent to the building owner and fire department where the report will be reviewed and determined whether any changes to the system need to be made.</p>
<h3>What happens if my building fails the test?</h3>
<p>In the event that your building fails its ERRC system test, a distributed antenna system will need to be installed in the building as a back-up system to boost the signal of the ERRC. To begin the process of setting up a DAS, you&#8217;ll need a permit from your local building department to construct it. Once the commercial DAS has been successfully constructed and installed, you&#8217;ll need to have the building tested again to ensure the strength of the signal is compliant with local, state, and federal requirements. The results of the new test will be compiled and given to your fire department who will conduct a final inspection of your ERRC and DAS before signing off on the system.</p>
<h3>Should I include the costs of an ERRC system in my budget?</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s recommended to include the costs of an ERRC system installation and DAS installation into the budget for your new commercial property or major renovation. By budgeting ahead of time, you&#8217;ll be better prepared for when you need the system installed so you won&#8217;t have to worry about not being compliant. Each commercial property has a different structure and layout and so every ERRC system will vary in terms of its signal. Because of this, you&#8217;ll not only want to budget for the ERRC system itself but also for the testing process. Depending on the square footage of your property and the signal your ERRC system provides, the cost to test your system could run anywhere from $250 to $1,500 per test. Budget for the higher end of this price range to keep any potential surprises from cutting into your budget.</p>
<p>Commercial developers may choose to include their ERRC system into the overall design-stage plans of their properties. This is because the overall technology infrastructure can sometimes be able to address potential connectivity and pathway issues for first responder communications. Remember that you need a permit before you begin constructing your ERRC system with the rest of your commercial property.</p>
<h3>Does my ERRC system really need to be retested after a renovation?</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s understandable not to want to retest an ERRC system after it&#8217;s already been tested once before. However, because layout changes can easily impact the signal of your ERRC system in your commercial property, it&#8217;s essential to have your ERRC system retested. Not only is it a requirement to have your ERRC system&#8217;s signal retested to remain compliant, but it also shows support for first responders. The last thing you want is to have <a href="http://rfeconnect.com">first responder communications</a> become interrupted in the event of an emergency because your ERRC system isn&#8217;t compliant with local, state, or federal requirements.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that ERRC systems not only need to be retested after a renovation, but they also need to be retested every year just like any other emergency alert system in your commercial building. This retesting is important should local authorities change their radio frequencies or if local authorities have updated recently to a digital-based system rather than an analog system.</p>
<p>Certain environmental or construction changes could also impact your ERRC system and require retesting to ensure these changes haven&#8217;t blocked radio signals. There are three main factors that can impact first responder communications: shadowing, attenuation, and diffraction. Shadowing refers to a radio signal becoming reduced due to changes in terrain or the new construction of buildings in your area. Attenuation is when the strength of the signal becomes reduced when passing through a building, and diffraction is when a signal bends around an object and becomes limited in its extent. ERRC testing is crucial to ensure first responder communications remain strong throughout your building despite any changes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the U.S., we depend on the medical expertise of first responders in a multitude of situations. An estimated 240 million calls made to 9-1-1 each year for a variety of reasons, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Severe pain</li>
<li>Difficulty breathing</li>
<li>Confusion or unusual behavior</li>
<li>Choking</li>
<li>Fainting or loss of consciousness</li>
<li>Severe vomiting</li>
<li>Thoughts of suicide or harm to others</li>
<li>Head or spinal injury</li>
<li>Incidents involving road collisions or house fires</li>
<li>Sudden dizziness or weakness</li>
<li>Ingesting a poisonous substance</li>
<li>Violent injury</li>
</ul>
<p>When we feel our lives &#8212; or the lives of others &#8212; are being threatened in some way, we rely on first responders to provide the help we need. But what you might not realize is that 80% or more of all of those millions of calls made each year are made from wireless devices. And while this type of technology is rather ubiquitous, it can cause a number of problems for first responder communications.</p>
<h3>What&#8217;s the Problem With Wireless Devices?</h3>
<p>Smartphones have certainly made it easier for the general public to communicate when they&#8217;re out and about. Rather than use a payphone or wait to use a landline at your home, you can place a call from your cell phone no matter where you are.</p>
<p>But cell phones do pose some challenges in the event of a medical emergency. In some cases, these devices have actually saved lives. But in others, they make it more difficult for medical personnel to do their jobs. Let&#8217;s take a closer look at some of these issues and how they can be solved by improved by <a href="http://rfeconnect.com">first responder wireless services</a>.</p>
<h3>How Are First Responder Communications Interrupted?</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s zero in on the problem first. While many people believe that our existing technology only stands to help medical personnel do their jobs in health emergencies, the reality is that our nation&#8217;s existing infrastructure hasn&#8217;t necessarily caught up with evolving tech or the needs of first responders. Because the FCC continues to make adjustments to how the radio spectrum is allotted, this can pose problems for first responder communications. In other words, the amount of frequencies that can be used for the needs of first responders is restricted &#8212; and that can lead to poor cell service.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re required to be in an area with bad reception on a call (whether it&#8217;s a rural location far from cell towers or an urban area with tall structures), you could jeopardize your ability to administer medical assistance &#8212; all because you can&#8217;t receive or send the information you need through existing first responder wireless services! That&#8217;s a huge problem when someone&#8217;s life is on the line. If you can&#8217;t hear the information you need to help a person in trouble, it&#8217;s much harder to do your job to the best of your ability.</p>
<h3>What is ERRCS?</h3>
<p>Now that you know the communication challenges first responders face, let&#8217;s talk about some of the solutions. An Emergency Responder Radio Communication System, or ERRCS, is an in-building requirement for many areas nationwide. It&#8217;s intended to improve vital communications that take place both within a building and from outside it specifically as they pertain to public safety. An ERRCS uses a Distributed Antenna System (or DAS) in order to send and receive radio signals from the network of first responders. An ERRCS also contains a Bi-Directional Amplifier (or BDA) system, which connects to the DAS through a cable or fiber in order to re-amplify signals throughout the building to offset areas of poor cell coverage.</p>
<p>You can think of an ERRCS like a megaphone. Without it, your own voice will be lost when talking to a crowd of people in a busy location. Even if you yell at the top of your lungs, the information might not be able to be heard. But if you use a megaphone to amplify your voice, others will be able to understand what&#8217;s being said and your message will be received loud and clear. An ERRCS can make sure nothing is lost in translation.</p>
<p>Your municipality may have different rules and regulations surrounding ERRCS requirements. But generally speaking, any building that has three or more stories, more than 50,000 square feet, or an underground parking facility will likely require an ERRCS to be installed. Keep in mind that buildings made of or containing materials like concrete, brick, wood, metal, and even low-e glass can make communications through traditional first responder wireless services more challenging because they&#8217;ll often block the signal. Even something as simple as a layout with multiple rooms or a space with thicker walls can make it harder for first responders to communicate clearly. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s essential that builders and developers follow all relevant codes pertaining to ERRCS installation to ensure public safety and overall compliance.</p>
<h3>How Can First Responder Cellular Boosters Eliminate Communication Barriers?</h3>
<p>Now, it&#8217;s important to remember that the presence of an ERRCS isn&#8217;t everything. There are other first responder wireless solutions that can improve the ability of medical personnel to serve the community as intended.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also necessary to install signal boosters to bolster first responder wireless services. Cell boosters can be placed in both emergency vehicles and in base stations to amplify signals sent and received by wireless devices. Police vehicles, fire engines, and EMS and ambulance vehicles can all benefit from the installation of cellular boosters. That way, first responders can easily communicate with hospitals, co-workers, and their base to ensure they have the right information and that people in trouble can receive the help they need as efficiently and safely as possible. With the addition of cellular boosters to first responder wireless services, the chances of a dropped call, spotty reception, or even missed text messages are reduced greatly.</p>
<h3>How We Can Strengthen First Responder Communications</h3>
<p>As a first responder, you already know the risks associated with your calling. While you may put helping others first, you can&#8217;t provide the assistance they need if you don&#8217;t have the right tools to access important information. Unfortunately, relying on an average cell phone isn&#8217;t an adequate plan. In order to ensure calls are clear and that nothing is missed, you need better first responder wireless services.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where RFeCommunications comes in. Whether your EMS staff needs cell network boosters in all vehicles or your facility is in a notorious &#8220;dead zone,&#8221; it&#8217;s essential that you prepare for the worst case scenario. In a medical emergency, you can&#8217;t leave anything up to chance &#8212; and that includes your first responder wireless services. Instead of crossing your fingers and hoping that calls will come through clearly, you need the peace of mind and the equipment necessary to prevent disaster.</p>
<p>At RFeCommunications, we offer cellular network boosters, DAS, and other wireless coverage options to ensure first responders can improve efficiency and safety for themselves and others. We know how tough the job of a first responder is; it shouldn&#8217;t be made harder by subpar wireless communication. Fortunately, there are solutions readily available to ensure your team has the intel they need and that the public is protected. Rather than wait for the next call to drop, your first responders can do their job efficiently and without unnecessary frustration related to technical problems.</p>
