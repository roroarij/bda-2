										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In our fast-paced world, consumers are constantly swapping out used devices for the newest gadget. The ever-present call for the hottest new feature and the most instantaneous service is tightening its grip on the manufacturing industry.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So how will manufacturers keep up with the pace of this ever-growing demand for complex goods? 5G might be the key.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Offering more than just faster speeds, 5G has the connectivity capabilities, low latency and dependability that is required to revolutionize many industries in the near future. The manufacturing industry, and many others, will have the chance to adopt massive machine type communication and AI by using large volumes of data.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">With data speeds projected to be 25 times faster than today’s 4G networks, 5G appears to promise unending opportunities to strengthen connectivity and digitization—both within the physical facility, and beyond them at every step along the entire value chain. Below, we’ll be reviewing three important ways 5G might change the game of manufacturing.</span></p>
<h2 class="p4"><span class="s1">CLOUD CONTROL OF MACHINES</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Automation in factories has relied on programmable logic controllers (PLCs) for decades. PLCs are usually installed on the machines they control and hard-wired into computer networks. If 5G delivers on its performance promises, PLCs can become virtual cloud applications, allowing machines to be controlled wirelessly in real time.</span></p>
<h2 class="p4"><span class="s1">DEVELOPMENT ON SMART FACTORIES</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The so-called Fourth Wave of the Industrial Revolution — coined Industry 4.0, is in its early stages of development. Smart manufacturing, a subset of Industry 4.0, is defined by The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as being “fully-integrated, collaborative manufacturing systems that respond in real time to meet changing demands and conditions in the factory, in the supply network, and in customer needs.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This connection allows manufacturers to further improve factory automation, human/machine interfaces, and mobility in their processes. Alongside the physical production of goods, 5G technologies can support improvements in functions such as planning, supply chain logistics, inventory management and product development, including lifecycle management.</span></p>
<h2 class="p4"><span class="s1">MAKING AUGMENTED REALITY THE NORM</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Augmented reality (AR) can also help manufacturing technicians identify problems quickly and efficiently. Unlike virtual reality, AR does not hide, or cloak, the physical world – it simply enhances it with a digital layer.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Augmented reality will allow shop-floor workers to undertake advanced tasks without waiting for specialist engineers or incurring costly machine downtime. The best knowledge and work instructions can, therefore, be shared with all workers exactly when they need it, building worker skills better (and faster) than ever before.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">5G will certainly not end world hunger and many of its claims are exaggerated. However, it can be argued that is will change many industries, including manufacturing, in ways we don’t quite understand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>From streaming videos more quickly to autonomous vehicles to empowering remote surgery, 5G technology has the promise of fundamentally changing many industries.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The rise in a variety of digital offerings created to meet heightened consumer expectations across many industries have carriers and venue owners scrambling. Luckily for these carriers and venue owners, several wireless technologies – such as repeaters, small cells, and DAS, are available to address network coverage issues for consumers in highly-populated areas.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For years, the telecom industry has questioned the future of distributed antenna systems (DAS) in the face of new technologies. Most industry leaders expect that 5G will not bring the demise of DAS, but require an entire ensemble of wireless technologies instead.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In many cases, boosting cellular connectivity inside a building may not require an overhaul of the entire building’s network infrastructure.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">New 5G bands and Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) are highlighting new opportunities to diversify the telecom ecosystem, including the rise of IoT, smart cities, and autonomous vehicles. But with great invention comes growing pains, forcing stakeholders to turn to cost-effective solutions to address 5G’s short frequency and range – and DAS is the perfect position to enable new connections.</span></p>
<h2 class="p4"><span class="s1">CONNECTING SMALL CELLS AND DAS</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Unlike small cells, DAS can be shared by multiple carriers and works by effectively creating one large cell by repeating signals throughout a building or venue.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">To fix network challenges in smaller building use cases, pairing DAS and small cells together is the most viable option. By having a DAS feed off small cells, building stakeholders can implement a cost-effective network that can handle a low capacity of multiple visitors and residents without the use of a base station.</span></p>
<h2 class="p4"><span class="s1">CONNECTING 5G AND CBRS</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the case of CBRS, DAS and small cells provide solutions to connect venue owners to their own private LTE networks as well as carrier networks. By using a DAS to connect to the CBRS band, large building owners, like in the case of a stadium, can implement a private LTE network that enables them with a secure network where their information can be handled internally, while still allowing visitors with connections to their wireless carrier providers. This will help venue owners that deploy the CBRS band, with a single technology that connects to private and commercial LTE.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This same combination of old and new wireless technologies is applicable to public safety as well. LTE will likely remain the backbone of these networks that connect first responders, but 5G will enable new public safety technologies.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The 5G era of connectivity is bound to be one of collaboration and not a replacement. With all the different wireless options it’s important to have a network backbone, such as a modular DAS system, that can improve coverage and density for all frequency bands involved in a modern telecom ecosystem from 3G through 5G to keep options open as new use cases arise.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">You have probably heard the phrase 5G wireless network technology being tossed around, but what does it mean exactly and why should you care about it within your own businesses?</p>
<p class="p1">To put it simply, 5G is the newest generation of mobile networks that have been created. This particular global wireless network has been designed to specifically connect everyone and everything together virtually. Yes, this also includes machines, objects, etc. How cool is that?</p>
<p class="p1">5G creates networking that is more reliable while creating massive wireless capacities. It is believed to be that 5G combined with already existing 4G LTE will be up to 20 times faster than 4G alone, making it the fastest wireless network that currently exists. This can and will improve browsing speeds and create an easy ability for multiple devices to run efficiently in the same area via the same tower. It has been proven that 5G technology can, first and foremost, help reduce costs while also increasing the production and efficiency of the company.</p>
<p class="p1">As you consider switching your business to this faster wireless technology, you will want to make sure that you budget. 5G hardware upfront can be a little more expensive to launch than 4G was, but it’s definitely worth it to help accelerate the growth and expansion of your business.</p>
<p class="p1">You will also want to make sure that you are working alongside engineers who can help you figure out the best way for you to utilize 5G in your business. For instance, if you’re working with machining, you will want to work with an engineer who can help you automate the system to develop the most efficient production moving forward in your company.</p>
<p class="p1">Lastly, be prepared for the data of your business to grow at a rapid rate. This can be accelerating but may get out of hand if you don’t make sure that you have the correct data analytics to accommodate the 5G wireless network installed. You will want to make sure that your company has the right tools in place that are capable of pulling the promising insights from this particular data.</p>
