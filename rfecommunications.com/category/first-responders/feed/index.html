										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">State-of-the-art emergency responder communication systems are critical in daily operations and emergency situations alike. Natural disasters, fires, large crime scenes, or even everyday accidents require a swift and reliable system for first responders. It’s no secret that the quantity and severity of mass shootings in the U.S. is on an upward trajectory that shows no sign of abatement. Many of these horrific events occur inside schools, hospitals and office buildings where First Responder radio systems have coverage challenges.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The solution to in-building radio coverage problems is best accomplished through the use of what’s called an Emergency Responder Radio Communication System, or ERRCS.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An <strong>ERRCS</strong> is quite similar to an Over-the-Air Cellular DAS. It used a donor antenna to receive the radio signals from the local first-responder network. These signals operate on private frequencies. The radio signals are then re-amplified in the building in areas that do not get adequate signal.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As a general contractor, construction project manager, or building owner, you may know that many jurisdictions now require NFPA (National Fire Protection Association) or IFC (International Fire Code) compliant public safety and emergency responder coverage (ERRC) as a prerequisite for getting an occupancy permit. You may even be confident that your building requires a public safety coverage solution (ERRCS) of some kind. But understanding the details of how coverage is tested and how it can be improved is complicated and varies greatly by jurisdiction. Local rules are mandated by the Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ), oftentimes the Fire Marshall.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Jurisdiction mandates will determine </span><span class="s1">what frequencies need to operate inside the building (800/700 MHz but occasionally VHF and UHF frequencies) and at what locations and strength. Generally, there will be system-testing requirements to get an initial permit and a required annual maintenance contract to ensure the system remains operational.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Building tenants and property owners are often looking for qualified resources to assist with the technical aspects of an ERRCS. At In-Building Wireless Solutions, we assist with education of the appropriate fire codes and technology solutions currently available. Working with public safety authorities, we can inform your staff of the current jurisdiction mandates, test the current signal strength readings of existing buildings in your area, and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If required design a cost-effective system that will comply with local codes.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We work on behalf of owners to understand the exact requirements and minimize the costs associated with implementation. It is often the case that testing of the building and discussion with the AHJ can substantially reduce the costs associated with implementing an ERRCS.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Police two-way radios are essential pieces of equipment, to protect citizens as well as the officers themselves from harm. Public safety, police, firefighters, EMTs and emergency-response professionals know the essentials of two-way radio use because it’s so central to their work.</span></p>
<h2 class="p2"><span class="s1">What Is An ERRCS?</span></h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">An emergency responder radio communication systems is an extension of the public safety radio network based on RF performance. An ERRCS improves in-building coverage for voice communications, and is beneficial to first responders by reaching poor signal areas affected by factors like Low-E glass, interior/exterior walls, interior clutter, external obstructions, and more.</span></p>
<h2 class="p2"><span class="s1">What Does an ERRCS System Look Like?</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An ERRCS looks much like an Over-the-Air Cellular DAS in some respects: it uses a donor antenna to receive the radio signals from the local first responder network – signals that operate on private frequencies. These signals are then re-amplified in the building at the required locations. This communication system is best for when you need to ensure that first responders can maintain wireless communications within a building structure in emergency situations.</span></p>
<h2 class="p2"><span class="s1">The Answer in Emergency Situations</span></h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The Columbine school shooting in 1999 marked one of the first times where easy access to cell phones played a role in a major emergency. Unfortunately, students could call newscasters, but could not convey accurate information, creating conflicting reports that confused first responders. And 911 dispatchers were flooded with calls, which did more harm than good. That frustrating scene of over-strained cellular networks has become familiar in such disasters as the attack on 9/11 and Hurricane Sandy.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">PTT over cell phones excel because they have dedicated bandwidth and a limited number of users.</span> <span class="s1">With the addition of bi-directional amplifiers, distributed antenna systems, and repeaters, reliable two-way radio coverage can be extended throughout a facility or across a campus in areas where cell phone signals cannot reach.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Effective, fast communication is absolutely vital for law enforcement officers and the personnel who support them. Whether you need a brand new communications setup or some accessories for your existing system, our experts can handle all of your agency’s needs. We design code compliant ERRCs, and assist with coming up with a realistic projection of systems cost before your construction begins. We have the tools, code understanding, and technology background to provide a code compliant system allowing first responder communication systems to work effectively when needed and keep building occupants safe. Contact us now to learn more or find radio communication solutions that will fit within your existing network.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>How Cellular Antennas Affect the Power of a Signal Booster System</h2>
<p>Cellular antennas represent two of the three essential pieces of a signal booster system, so you’d better believe they can affect the power and performance of the system. Each antenna adds a different element to the equation and picking the right set of antennas can be almost as important as choosing the right booster.</p>
<p><strong>There are five factors under your control which determine the output power of your signal booster system:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Gain of outdoor antenna</li>
<li>Cable run loss between outdoor antenna and signal amplifier</li>
<li>Gain of signal amplifier</li>
<li>Cable run loss between signal amplifier and indoor antenna</li>
<li>Gain of indoor antenna</li>
</ul>
<p>So, even though the amplifier will do most of the heavy lifting, it’s possible to add some serious kick to your system with the right cellular antennas. This can be especially useful in areas where your signal is weak.</p>
<h2>What an Outdoor Cellular Antenna Does, and How to Use Them</h2>
<p>An outdoor (or donor) cellular antenna captures existing signal on the cellular bandwidths and attaches to a cellular signal booster for amplification. These antennas are usually wideband, with a 4G cellular antenna capturing any signal in its radiation pattern between the 698-2700 MHz range (broken into 698-960 MHz and 1710-2700 MHz ranges, specifically).</p>
<p>Donor antennas are the first major piece of a signal booster system and are usually the most difficult to set up properly. This is due to several factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>They need to be set up in the area with the strongest cell signal for best performance. This is usually on the roof of the building.</li>
<li>Many require precise aiming. This applies solely to directional antennas, with Yagi antennas being easier to aim than LPDAs. They need to be aimed toward a cell tower near you.</li>
<li>They need proper cabling, and that cabling needs to run indoors to your signal amplifier.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first and third steps above apply to all outdoor antennas, but the second will vary depending on your outdoor antenna type.</p>

<p>The Yagi antenna (also known as a Yagi-Uda antenna) was invented in 1926 by Japanese inventors Shintaro Uda and Hidetsugu Yagi. Since then, they have played a major role in RF transmission around the world. Improving cellular signal is one of the most common uses of a Yagi antenna and this article will specifically cover cellular Yagi antennas. Here’s an interesting article covering <a href="https://www.dxzone.com/the-true-story-of-yagi-antenna/">the history of Yagi-Uda antennas</a>. Otherwise, let’s get going.</p>
<h3>What is a Yagi Antenna?</h3>
<p>A Yagi antenna is a directional antenna that <strong>improves radiation in a single direction</strong>, and such radiation can be either transmission or reception of energy, such as cell signal.</p>
<h3>What is a Yagi Antenna Used For?</h3>
<p>Yagi antennas have different purposes. At an industrial level, they can work for radars to detect movement or for ham radio. At a consumer level, they can be used to enhance Over-The-Air television reception and, nowadays, <strong>cellular Yagi antennas can boost cell signal at home or at work</strong> where remote areas struggle to ensure quality in telecommunications. However, we don’t recommend using them to boost cell signal in your vehicle. We will explain why in a moment.</p>
<h3>How Does a Yagi Antenna Work?</h3>
<p>A Yagi antenna works through the interaction of four essential pieces:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Driven Element:</strong> The driven element of a Yagi is the point where the feed line is attached from the transmitter to the Yagi to perform the transfer of power from the transmitter to the antenna.</li>
<li><strong>Director(s):</strong> Used to provide the antenna with directional power and gain.</li>
<li><strong>Line:</strong> The spine of the antenna used to hold the directors and reflectors and connect to the driven element.</li>
<li><strong>Reflector:</strong> Used to reject signal outside its range as well as amplify what’s inside &#8211; think of a mirror reflecting light.</li>
</ol>
<p>These pieces allow Y<strong>agi antennas to achieve higher gain than omnidirectional antennas.</strong></p>
<p>They don’t perform well in a vehicle, as driving or sailing creates a constant change of direction. However, the directional nature of a Yagi makes it ideal for home and commercial installations, as it allows for greater gain and reach.</p>
<h3>Is a Yagi Antenna Directional?</h3>
<p>Yes. To be exact, a Yagi antenna is unidirectional, and that’s the main feature when improving cell signal: it aims to <strong>maximize the reception of signal from a particular carrier</strong> in just one direction.</p>
<h3>How Far Can a Yagi Antenna Reach?</h3>
<p>A typical Yagi is effective up to 5 miles – but generally speaking will work best up to around 3. If you’re seeking to amplify cell signal, Yagi antennas come with either 50 or 75 ohm configurations, depending on the use case of your system (commercial or consumer usage). <strong>Yagi antennas are three times more powerful than omnidirectional antennas</strong> because they are frequency-specific, work with one or two carriers, and can be placed to reach the best possible signal wherever you are.</p>
<h3>How Do I Aim a Yagi Antenna?</h3>
<p>You should aim the outdoor antenna <strong>in the direction that best receives the signal from your carrier</strong> because a Yagi antenna will not receive any signal that is out of the direction they point to. In other words, if your carrier is out of the beam of the antenna, you won’t receive the boost you’re looking for. Thus, we recommend finding your nearest cell tower before pointing your yagi antenna.</p>
<h2>Omnidirectional Antennas: The Simple Setup</h2>

<p>Omnidirectional (or omni) cellular antennas pull in signal from all directions. Cellular omnidirectional antennas are common sights in low-lying areas, or attached to the sides of commercial buildings. While omnidirectional antennas exist for all sorts of RF, this article will focus on cellular.</p>
<h3>What is an Omnidirectional Antenna Used For?</h3>
<p>Omnidirectional antennas are the most useful for multi-carrier setups and are far easier to install than other outdoor options. They pull in all existing signal in an area. This has several advantages, but also a few disadvantages.</p>
<p>There are three major advantages to omnidirectional antennas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy installation</li>
<li>Will amplify all cell signal in your area, from multiple carriers with different cell towers in multiple locations</li>
<li>Superb in strong signal areas and low-lying valleys</li>
</ul>
<p>However, they also have some disadvantages when compared to Yagi and LPDA antennas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t reach as far as a directional antenna</li>
<li>Don’t give as much gain to your incoming signal as a directional antenna</li>
<li>Susceptible to “signal noise” and can become overwhelmed in extremely busy urban areas</li>
<li>Not optimized for rural areas where distance from the cell tower is the main problem</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also some physical limitations to omnidirectional antennas that warrant bearing in mind.</p>
<p>All that said, omnidirectional antennas work extremely well in strong-to-middling strength signal areas, and, when paired with a powerful enough amplifier, are more than equipped to do a great job.</p>
<h2>Cellular Log-Periodic Dipole Array (LPDA) Antenna: The Highest Power</h2>
<div class="blog-modern-product-box">
<div class="image"><img decoding="async" class="lazyautosizes lazyloaded" src="https://www.wilsonamplifiers.com/product_images/uploaded_images/wilson-lpda-antenna.png" sizes="227px" alt="High Gain LPDA Antenna - 311228" data-sizes="auto" data-src="/product_images/uploaded_images/wilson-lpda-antenna.png" /></div>

<p class="blurb">Powerful directional antenna with up to 13.1 dBi</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Log-periodic antennas are known by many names: LPDA (short for log-periodic dipole array), log-periodic dipole antenna, log-periodic aerial, or just a log-periodic array. They have a simple job: <strong>to operate over a wide band of radio frequencies</strong>. What these frequencies bandwidths are vary based on the type of log periodic antenna you buy.</p>
<p>They’re more common than you might think. You’ve probably noticed log periodic antennas in passing all your life, sitting atop suburban and rural rooftops, poking out on apartment balconies. Traditionally, log periodic antennas have been used for analog television, which was the dominant style until digital eclipsed and replaced it in the recent past. Even still, they remain used in many areas, and, as a quick search for a TV antenna will show you, they continue to dominate that market.</p>
<p>The reason for this is simple: they <strong>have excellent range and can cover a wide range of broadband frequencies</strong>. Their directivity allows them to have a narrower focus than their cousins the Yagi antenna, which <strong>gives them increased power over their brethren</strong>. Properly installed, they will work in fringe areas Yagi&#8217;s just can’t.</p>
<h3>How Do Log Periodic Dipole Array (LDPA) Antennas Work?</h3>
<p>Log periodic antennas (hereafter referred to as ‘LPDA’ or ‘LPDAs’) normally consist of half-wave dipole elements each consisting of a pair of metal rods positioned along a support boom lying along the antenna axis. The spacing of these elements are what allow for the tuning of the frequency range of the LPDA &#8211; meaning, cellular LPDAs are finely tuned in such a way as to pick up cellular frequencies between the 698-2700 MHz frequencies. Other LPDA antennas focus on <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/personal-radio-services-prs-keeping-touch">VHF</a>, <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/public-safety/uhfvhf-bands">UH</a>F, WiFi, <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-opens-6-ghz-band-wi-fi-and-other-unlicensed-uses">and other wavelengths in the high frequency GHz spectrum</a>.</p>
<p>LPDA antennas are contrasted with <a href="https://interferencetechnology.com/emc-antenna-parameters-and-their-relationships/">EMC antennas</a>, which operate electromagnetically, and <a href="https://www.antenna-theory.com/arrays/main.php">array antennas</a>, which are big, complicated arrays of numerous antennas that can both transmit and receive. LPDAs are significantly more diverse in their usage &#8211; they can operate off standard power and can be installed just about anywhere at not too great of a cost.</p>
<p>LPDA antennas <strong>focus on antenna gain</strong> (measured in dBi). While a Yagi or omni antenna focuses on bringing in signal within relatively close environs, the LPDA can work adequately in fringe conditions. This is accomplished with a relatively focused radiation pattern, at a roughly 30-degree beamwidth.</p>
<p>A radiation pattern with such high gain and wide bandwidth is achieved by creating a three-element Yagi antenna. These are called <strong>driven elements</strong>, connected electrically to the feedline. This feedline &#8211; usually coaxial cable, but sometimes twin-lead or ladder line &#8211; zig zags between the dipole elements. Certain LPDAs are known as <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US3355740">log-periodic zig zag antennas</a> because they replace the dipoles with the feedline itself.</p>
<h2>Yagi vs. Omni vs. LPDA: Which Cellular Antenna is Best for Me?</h2>
<p>There are a few major differences between the three major cellular antennas (Yagi, omni, and LPDAs), all of which have been hinted at above.</p>
<h3>How They Are the Same</h3>
<p>Omnidirectional antennas, Yagi antennas, and LPDAs pull in existing cellular signal (5G, 5G E, 4G LTE, and 3G, depending on the bandwidths covered by the antenna). All of them increase the power of the signal upon pulling it in, but the extent to which that happens varies depending on the type.</p>
<h3>How They Differ</h3>
<p>Omni antennas are the standard antenna type. They catch signal <strong>in a 360-degree field, and do not discriminate</strong>. They will seize any cellular signal that exists, whether you want it or not. This is great if you have several cell sites nearby, since you can easily multiple carriers at once. Omni-directional antennas nearly always look like rod shaped cylinders. Think of a radio antenna you might have on your car &#8211; this is an omni antenna.</p>
<p>The main disadvantage of an omni antenna is its power. Due to its 360-degree radiation pattern, both its range and overall dBi gain are lower than directional antennas.</p>
<p>However, this disadvantage comes with some very real perks: <strong>omni antennas are ideal for multi-carrier setups in strong outside signal environments</strong>. Many of our corporate clients prefer omni antennas, because they usually must service multiple carriers (AT&amp;T, Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile, etc.) inside their buildings.</p>
<p>Although it’s plausible for two T-Mobile or any other same-carrier towers to be close enough to each other that the omni-antenna pulls in signal from both, it&#8217;s most likely a rare situation. Depending on the location, you’ll most likely be close to one of each carrier tower (i.e., one AT&amp;T tower, one T-Mobile, one Verizon tower, etc., not two AT&amp;T towers, three T-Mobile towers, one Verizon, etc.).</p>
<p>That’s where an LPDA or Yagi antenna come in. These are more specialized, with Yagi antennas being more general use than LPDAs. Their <strong>directionality allows for longer range and higher gain</strong>, with the LPDA being more directional than the Yagi. This directionality allows for more precise and powerful signal to reach your amplifier.</p>
<p>The <strong>more remote you are, the more directional you’ll want to think</strong>. Conversely, if you’re in an extremely urban area and are bombarded with irrelevant signal, becoming more directional can help with that, too.</p>
<h3>Which Outdoor Antenna Gives the Highest Gain?</h3>
<p><strong>Log-periodic dipole array (LPDA) antennas</strong> give the highest gain in almost every situation. LPDA antennas have longer range and higher gain than Yagi and omnidirectional antennas <strong>but are harder to aim and very directional</strong>. However, these are far and away your <strong>best option in rural or weak signal areas</strong>.</p>
<h2>What an Indoor Cellular Antenna Does, and How to Use Them</h2>
<p>Indoor cellular antennas are the piece which <strong>broadcasts the cellular signal captured by outdoor antennas in buildings</strong>. Like outdoor antennas, they come in two varieties: panel and dome.</p>
<p>Panel and dome antennas get their name from their shape, which plays a role in how they operate. The dome shape allows the antenna to broadcast the boosted signal in every direction, making it a type of omni-directional antenna. A panel antenna only broadcasts signals in one direction, making it a directional antenna.</p>
<p>These need to be <strong>placed where you most desire signal</strong>. The closer you are to the radiation pattern of the indoor antenna, the stronger your signal will be. This directly affects the coverage area of your signal booster system.</p>
<h2>Panel Antennas: Versatility and Power</h2>
<div class="blog-modern-product-box">
<div class="image"><img decoding="async" class="lazyautosizes lazyloaded" src="https://www.wilsonamplifiers.com/product_images/uploaded_images/wilson-indoor-panel-antenna.png" sizes="206px" alt="Wilson Panel Antenna - 311135" data-sizes="auto" data-src="/product_images/uploaded_images/wilson-indoor-panel-antenna.png" /></div>

<p class="blurb">Popular in-building directional antenna with up to 10.6 dBi</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The majority of weBoost signal booster kits by RFeCommunications use panel antennas. They are wall-mounted and send signals in a directional cone ranging from 45 to 70 degrees. Having such a narrow focus allows for stronger signal at the source (i.e. the closer to the panel antenna, the better the signal).</p>
<p>On average, they give 75 feet of coverage. This varies depending on how strong the outside signal is. If there is strong signal outside, there will be more coverage. Weak signal areas will get less.</p>
<p>The reason why panel antennas are generally recommended first is because of inside interference, and their higher gain. Building materials such as metal, concrete, and energy-efficient barriers can disrupt signals from penetrating the building. Once inside with the help of a signal booster, dense walls and other RF-disrupting material (metal, glass, sheetrock, etc.) can equally disturb the signal coming from the inside antenna.</p>
<p>With a panel antenna, you’re able to focus the signal within a specific location in your home or commercial building that needs better signal, such as your living room, home office, or conference room. As a result, the signal being broadcasted in that area will face minimal interference. Every device in that room will receive better signal and faster data first before the signal spreads to lower priority areas.</p>
<p>To improve the signal in the rooms with limited to nonexistent coverage, the panel antenna can be installed right side up or upside down on a wall, and in some cases on a high ceiling. If installed on the ceiling, due to its beamwidth and strength, it can also improve the signal in the lower levels of your house or commercial building. However, the signal won’t be as strong in the lower levels as it is in the room where the antenna is located because the building materials it must travel through interferes with the signal’s strength.</p>
<h2>Dome Antennas: Convenience and Coverage</h2>
<div class="blog-modern-product-box">

<p class="blurb">Powerful &amp; discreet in-building omni with up to 7 dBi</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Dome antennas are ceiling-mounted and broadcast amplified signal 360 degrees horizontally &#8211; think of its broadcasting beam as half a sphere. This provides a wide horizontal spread of coverage to deliver equal signal in every direction.</p>
<p>Depending on your outside signal strength, on average you’ll get about 50 feet of coverage with a dome antenna. Areas with poor cellular service will probably receive much less coverage.</p>
<p>When considering a dome antenna, keep in mind that you’ll need access to a crawl space or attic for proper installation. Thus, they tend to be better for commercial use, one-story homes, or multi-level homes with drop ceilings.</p>
<p>When installed under perfect conditions, meaning low ceilings and zero to minimal inside interference, dome antennas are phenomenal at broadcasting improved 3G, 4G LTE, and 5G signals in large areas.</p>
<p>However, if you have high ceilings (usually 20-30 feet or higher) and thick or numerous walls, then a dome antenna isn’t be recommended, since the signal will weaken the further it travels.</p>
<h2>Dome and Panel Antenna Gain</h2>
<p>Every type of antenna has a certain amount of gain associated with them, measured in dB (decibels). Simply put, gain represents an <a href="https://www.jpole-antenna.com/2014/03/28/antenna-gain-explained/">antenna’s ability to direct the signal</a> it’s broadcasting and how far the signal can travel. Antennas with high gain usually mean they are more directional, which results in more reach. On the other hand, lower gain antennas tend to be the opposite. We’ve covered this in the outdoor antenna section.</p>
<p>Panel antennas, since they are directional, will have more gain and reach than a dome antenna. Our regular dome antennas feature up to +5.1 dB of gain and the low-profile dome antennas feature up to +6 or +7 dB of gain, while the panel antennas tend to feature up to +7.6 dB or up to +10.6 dB of gain.</p>
<p>If you live in an area with weak signal, a higher gain antenna will probably be your best option. This will allow the broadcasted signal to be a tad bit stronger and travel a tad bit further in your home or commercial building than it would with a dome antenna.</p>
<h2>Panel vs. Dome: Which Should I Get?</h2>
<p>A good rule of thumb when trying to choose between dome and panel antennas is to think about:</p>
<ul>
<li>The shape of the area in which you want to boost the signal</li>
<li>What inside interference exists in the area</li>
<li>How much of a priority is coverage in that area</li>
</ul>
<p>Do you have <strong>lots of inside interference</strong> &#8211; thick walls, metal, and glass &#8211; around your home or building? Is there a specific area you want priority service, such as a closed off room or corridor? If you answered yes to any of those questions, then <strong>go with a panel antenna</strong>.</p>
<p>Do you have <strong>open spaces</strong> with virtually no walls, thin walls, or minimal inside interference? Do you want to broadcast an equal amount of signal throughout your home or building? Do you have low ceilings and access to a crawl space or attic? If yes, then <strong>go with a dome antenna</strong>.</p>
<p>Depending on your outside signal strength and the size of your building, it’s entirely possible one antenna will not be enough to provide the coverage you want, especially in multi-level residential or commercial buildings. To maximize your coverage area, you may want to consider getting splitters and a combination of panel and dome antennas. If you decide to purchase additional antennas, make sure their impedance rating of 50 Ohms or 75 Ohms matches that of your signal booster, otherwise, you&#8217;ll need additional connectors and adapters and have more loss.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Other Indoor Antenna Types</h2>
<p>Dome and panel antennas are not the only types of indoor antennas available; they are just the most common. There are two other types of indoor antennas that can be paired with booster systems designed to cover one to two rooms, such as the weBoost Home Studio and the weBoost Home Room.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Terminal Antennas or Whip Antennas</strong> attach directly to the signal amplifier &#8211; similar to a WiFi router’s rubber ducky antenna. They’re omni-directional just like the dome antenna but not as powerful.</li>
<li><strong>Desktop Antennas</strong> have a nice, discreet design. They are omni-directional and can be placed on any flat surface for better signal wherever you need it most. They can even be used in vehicles!</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Avoid Signal Oscillation Between Cellular Antennas</h2>
<p>Oscillation is one of the most common answers to the question: “Why doesn’t my cell signal booster work?”</p>
<p>It’s a feedback loop between your two antennas, caused by them <strong>being installed too close together</strong>.</p>
<p>Think of a speaker and a microphone. When you bring the microphone too close to a speaker, an unpleasant humming sound is created, with the screech getting louder and louder the closer they are together. This is oscillation, and it occurs with your antennas, too.</p>
<p>This is a problem that’s fixed by increasing the distance between the three components of your signal booster. Your antennas need to be <strong>at least 50 feet apart horizontally, or 20 feet vertically</strong> in order to prevent oscillation. Unfortunately, if you’ve set up your antennas for your ideal setup, you may have to move one or both antennas to a slightly less optimal position for you to get rid of the oscillation. However, this is balanced by the fact that the booster’s performance will dramatically increase, and that should more than make up for the fact that the broadcast antenna might not always be in the perfect position.</p>
<h2>How to Prevent Signal Booster Overload</h2>
<p>Most consumer boosters have the possibility of overload. If you’ve bought a cheaper signal booster, have fantastic outdoor signal but terrible indoor signal, and use high-gain antennas and cable, you might be <strong>delivering too much signal to your booster, and overloading it</strong>. This causes the booster to shut down completely, in order to save itself.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this is very easy to fix, with multiple options as to how you go about it.</p>
<p>If you want to throw money at the problem and deal with it easily, we sell attenuators to slightly decrease the amount of signal you’re bringing in and prevent overload. There are also commercial-grade boosters that automatically attenuate the signal you’re receiving, but they come with a rather high price tag and are overkill for most home setups.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to spend any more money, you’ll need to place your antenna differently. There are two options for this: placing it in a spot with weaker signal than where you have it or turning it away from a signal that’s too strong, thereby attenuating the signal. This is the easiest, cheapest method, if you don’t mind going on the roof again.</p>
<h2>What is a Vehicle Cellular Antenna, and How Do I Use Them?</h2>
<p>Vehicle antennas can be thought of as smaller, portable versions of indoor and outdoor antennas. The biggest difference is that every outdoor vehicle antenna is omnidirectional, since vehicles are prone to moving about and will need to constantly broadcast and downlink cellular signal. Thus, the difference between vehicle outdoor antennas is simply how large and powerful the antennas are.</p>
<h2>Magnet Mount Antennas: Easy to Use, Easy to Install</h2>

<p>Magnet mount antennas should need no introduction – they&#8217;re simply little antennas you <strong>mount magnetically to the frame of a vehicle</strong>. They provide minimal gain but have far and away the simplest installation, unless you have an aluminum frame. A magnet mount antenna can be used on any vehicle viably, but struggle at times to cover larger interiors.</p>
<p>The most common magnet mount antenna is the 4” magnet mount, which comes standard in vehicle signal booster kits. There are also <strong>12” magnet mounts, which provide a bit more gain</strong> across the standard cellular bandwidths. These are inexpensive upgrades and should be considered by anyone who is having issues covering the cabin of their vehicle with a powerful vehicle booster like the weBoost Drive Reach.</p>
<h2>Over-the-Road (OTR) Antennas: For Trucks and Large Cabins</h2>

<p>An Over-the-Road Antenna is a mounted antenna designed <strong>for semi-trucks and RVs, but can be used in pickup trucks or large SUVs</strong>. These are much larger and more powerful than a magnet mount, but are more challenging to install. If you spend lots of time on the road, or have a large cabin or interior, an OTR antenna can be a very valuable investment.</p>
<p>There isn’t too much to go into here: an <strong>OTR is a more powerful omnidirectional vehicle antenna</strong>. If your vehicle is large enough to warrant it, you spend considerable time in your vehicle outside of urban areas, or you’re not getting the boost you need from a magnet mount and a powerful mobile booster, then an OTR will help you.</p>

<h2>Magnet Mount vs. OTR vs. NMO: Which Cellular Antenna is Best for My Vehicle?</h2>
<p>This is a simpler choice than with building antennas.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cars:</strong> 4” magnet mounts are sufficient for most cars. Upgrade: 12” magnet mount</li>
<li><strong>SUVs:</strong> 4” magnet mounts work on most SUVs. Upgrade: 12” magnet mount or OTR</li>
<li><strong>Pickup:</strong> 4” magnet mounts work on most pickups. Upgrade: 12” magnet mount or OTR</li>
<li><strong>RVs:</strong> OTR. 4” magnet mount will work in a pinch.</li>
<li><strong>Semi-trucks:</strong> OTR. 12” magnet mount will work in a pinch.</li>
<li><strong>Fleet vehicles of any type:</strong> NMO. OTRs will work as an alternative</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other Types of Vehicle Cellular Antennas</h2>
<p>There are a few other types of vehicle antennas to go over, but their use cases are less complex:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Marine antennas</strong> are large, waterproof antennas designed to be used aboard&#8230;well, marine vehicles. They can be used to ensure cellular coverage of a boat’s cabin up to several miles offshore. Get one of these if you have a boat.</li>
<li><strong>Low-profile antennas</strong> are the most common type of interior antenna for vehicles, being packaged in nearly every multi-user kit. They resemble candy bars and are designed not to stand out and transmit directionally.</li>
<li><strong>Desktop Antennas</strong> are small interior antennas best used in RVs or vehicles with extremely large cabins. They are trickier to place than low-profile antennas but provide slightly higher gain.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3>Is Higher dBi Better for Antennas?</h3>
<p>In general, yes. However, there are many reasons you might consider dropping a few dBi levels: convenience of installation, getting multiple carriers in your network, overall cost, and whether your booster is likely to overload from too much incoming signal.</p>
<h3>I’ve Heard Some Talk About 5G Cellular Antennas. What’s the Difference Between them and a 4G Cellular Antenna?</h3>
<p>A “5G” antenna usually adds the T-Mobile 5G band, which brings its range to 600-2700 MHz. These do nothing for Verizon or AT&amp;T 5G, which are broadcast on millimeter wave and not cellular bands. Thus, they can be used with 5G-compatible signal boosters on the T-Mobile 5G network.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, cell phone users expect high-quality indoor coverage. Whether in restaurants, malls, hotels, hospitals, schools, or other areas, cell phone users do not expect dropped calls and poor reception. But how can indoor coverage be improved, and why is it essential, especially for first responders? Keep reading to learn more.</p>
<h3>What is Indoor Coverage?</h3>
<p>Indoor coverage involves providing coverage of places that are not covered by traditional networks. Some of these places include basements and buildings made of thick materials.</p>
<h3>What Causes Poor Indoor Coverage?</h3>
<p>A variety of factors can cause poor indoor coverage. Some of the common ones include:</p>
<h3>Construction Materials</h3>
<p>Modern construction materials such as concrete, metal, concrete, bricks, and even energy-efficient glass can negatively impact indoor coverage because cellular signals find it difficult to pass through these materials.</p>
<h3>Distance</h3>
<p>To receive good reception, you need to be close to a cell phone tower. The further you are from a cell phone tower, the poorer your signal is likely to be.</p>
<h3>Topography</h3>
<p>While natural features such as mountains and hills provide breathtaking views, they can obstruct cell phone signals and reduce indoor coverage.</p>
<h3>Frequencies</h3>
<p>Higher frequencies, such as 4G and 5G, offer greater bandwidth. As a result, they can allow you to send more data in less time than lower frequencies. Unfortunately, they are less penetrative compared to lower frequencies like 2G and 3G.</p>
<h3>How Poor Indoor Coverage Affects Public Safety</h3>
<p>Many people have ditched traditional landlines in favor of cell phones. As a result, today, it is estimated that 80% of indoor calls are made from cell phones. Several of these calls are distress calls. Distress calls need to go through without fail, making good indoor coverage a public safety concern.</p>
<p>Ideally, if someone places a distress call, first responders need to receive the call promptly to act immediately. Unfortunately, because indoor coverage is poor in many buildings, sometimes first responders cannot respond quickly enough.</p>
<p>So how can first responder communications be improved? Here are some ways to improve it:</p>
<h3>First Responder Distributed Antenna Systems (DAS)</h3>
<p>A <a href="http://rfeconnect.com/use-cases/first-responders/">first responder DAS</a> is simply a network of independent antennas linked to the same source. Together, they can improve indoor coverage within an area such as a building with several floors or a stadium. First responder DAS is typically ideal for large areas such as tall buildings.</p>
<h3>Pros of First Responder DAS</h3>
<p><strong>Supports Many Users: </strong> First responder DAS guarantees quality reception and excellent connectivity even if the number of users is high.</p>
<p><strong>Cost-Effective: </strong> Commercial DAS utilizes several low power networks instead of one high power one.</p>
<h3>First Responder Cellular Boosters</h3>
<p>Like DAS, commercial cell boosters can also improve indoor coverage and enhance public safety. Once they detect a signal in an area, they amplify it and transmit the amplified signal throughout the area.</p>
<h3>Pros of First Responder Cellular Boosters</h3>
<p><strong>Inexpensive: </strong> They tend to be cheaper to implement than DAS networks.</p>
<p><strong>Enhance Signal Strength: </strong> They can improve signal strength and enable first responders to respond quickly to emergencies.</p>
<p>Emergencies are inevitable. When they do strike, first responders need to respond to them fast. By implementing the above technologies, you can guarantee the safety of the people inside your premises and aid first responders.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Being a first responder is a job that you should be immensely proud of. It is not only a necessary task in our society, but a difficult and arduous one as well. From helping to escort people from bad health situations to literally digging underground for someone who is trapped, the work activities of a first responder are constantly varied and changing. What seems to be lacking in this department is <a href="http://rfeconnect.com">first responder wireless services</a>, which seem to remain static over the years. Since most first responders use cell phones in emergency situations, this needs to be looked at.</p>
<p>Cell phones are vital to first responders doing their job, but they aren&#8217;t always reliable, especially indoors. In fact, almost 80% of cell phone calls are made indoors. While it may be fine to have a dropped call occasionally, it is not something that you want hindering you in an emergency situation. If you&#8217;re part of a first responder team, you need to be able to clearly and succinctly communicate with people who are in distress and may not have many other options.</p>
<p>In this article, we&#8217;ll go over how using a cellular booster in tandem with first responder wireless services is a smart way to keep communication flowing. Not only does it work technologically, but it&#8217;s a sound way to reduce legal liability and eliminate personal worry and anxiety on the job. Being a first responder, or part of a disaster response team is stressful enough. Arm yourself with the right tools to get the job done every time.</p>
<h3>Having A Clear Connection Reduces Any Legal Liability You Might Have</h3>
<p>Depending on where your first responder wireless services are based, you&#8217;re probably expected to have a clear and stable connection at all times. When someone&#8217;s life is on the line, a steady wireless connection is vital. Instead of frantically worrying that someone in harm&#8217;s way will get disconnected from you, ask your team or leader about investing in a first responder cellular booster. It&#8217;s a smart choice that makes sure communication continues, even with the worst connection.</p>
<h3>You Can Perform Your Job To The Fullest Capabilities</h3>
<p>One of the best things about investing in first responder cellular boosters is the high degree of flexibility that they provide. You may find yourself in a situation in which you are trying to communicate by cell phone while excavating people trapped underground or in a hard-to-reach area. In normal situations, your cell phone would not suffice and you would be left on your own to complete your duties with standard first responder wireless services. But when you have a booster, you may be able to go above and beyond to truly reach your potential as a first responder and make an impact on someone&#8217;s life.</p>
<h3>Get Increased Access To Data, Optimization, And Other Services</h3>
<p>Cell phones are essentially tiny computers, and getting good cell service doesn&#8217;t just mean a dropped call or text that wasn&#8217;t received. Getting the best first responder wireless solutions is about making sure that all necessary data goes through. When you invest in first responder communications that fit your budget, needs, and future wants, you&#8217;ll be able to pick exactly what is necessary. This means that all of your data, internet connections, applications, and more, will be ready to access when you need it.</p>
<h3>Give You And Your Team The Best Package Possible</h3>
<p>When you&#8217;re considering a change to your first responder wireless services, be smart and look at investing or upgrading your existing architecture. Adding a cellular booster will ensure clear communication, which is vital in any emergency situation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The data first responders receive in the field can allow them to make critical decisions. They can quickly determine when to call for backup or start an evacuation process. But the information has to be reliable and timely.</p>
<p>However, conventional networks are fraught with challenges such as interference and poor network signal. In this article, we’ll look at some of the developments in technology facilitating communication for first responders.</p>
<h3>Cellular Networks and Their Limitations</h3>
<p>Under normal circumstances, the cellphone can have good coverage that can facilitate communications across large distances. But due to certain factors, the signal strength can be unreliable. For example, during disasters, there is a lot of demand which may overload communications the network.</p>
<p>To sustain communications, first responders today can utilize a set of backup systems. One way is to use radio communications to act as an alternative when the cellular network is unstable. Radio can be a viable solution in the absence of first responder cellular boosters.</p>
<h3>Using Land Mobile Radios (LMRs) as a Backup</h3>
<p>Depending on the location, cellular networks may be unreliable due to obstacles on their path weakening the signal. Land Mobile Radios are ideal for voice communications. Modern radio systems can be quickly deployed in sites where there is a natural disaster. They provide timely first responder communications in locations where it is required the most.</p>
<h3>Deploying a High-Speed Data Infrastructure</h3>
<p>High-speed connections can carry quality data, including images and video. Quality information improves <a href="http://rfeconnect.com">first responder communications</a> and security. It enhances situational awareness, which is essential for the safety of both the responder and the patient.</p>
<h3>5G and Artificial Intelligence</h3>
<p>In the future, analysts project that technologies like 5G will enhance the delivery of rich data. 5G is a high bandwidth, low latency technology that can allow instant transmission of high-resolution videos. It will be possible to receive live video and social media streams via 5G first responder wireless solutions.</p>
<p>The low latency of 5G can make IoT and AI applications more robust and effective. For example, firefighters can fly a drone over a building to analyze and plan their firefighting strategies. Also, mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones allow responders to work in the field while still accessing data.</p>
<h3>Optimizing the Network’s Capacity</h3>
<p>First responder communications today incorporate a wealth of rich data that was not possible with traditional systems. To make the most of the information, the first responder infrastructure has to enhance how it processes data.</p>
<p>For example, using advanced mapping tools, responders can identify the location in a three-dimensional space. It can give the user the vertical position of the caller in need of emergency assistance. First responder wireless services must coalesce the data to improve the quality of information it can generate.</p>
<p>While first responder communications today are much faster, they are run on systems that require support. There is usually staff present to address issues with the infrastructure or the applications. Security is also a crucial aspect of a robust network that supports first responders.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Responding to any kind of emergency call can prove intimidating, but it’s something first responders do on the job every single day. Whether it’s police officers, firefighters, or EMTs, they rely on calls to respond to emergencies.</p>
<p>Because they are so many risks involved in responding to unknown situations, communication is one of the most important tools a first responder can have. Yet, first responders often lose communications for a variety of reasons, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interference: Electronic equipment and heavy machinery can easily create interfering signals that can disrupt a first responder’s communications at the worst possible times. In fact, something like a generator can disrupt calls.</li>
<li>Being out of range: Most radios used by first responders have a predetermined range. The same can be said for cell phones. When they’re out of range of a cell tower, it can be hard to send and receive messages.</li>
<li>Damaged equipment: Believe it or not, cell towers can be damaged. When that happens, cell phone coverage can be greatly reduced.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what are first responders to do to improve their communication? The answer is simple: use first responder cellular boosters.</p>
<p>It’s estimated that 80% of calls are made indoors and with a first responder cellular booster, a police officer or a firefighter can use the booster to make calls in times of great emergencies.</p>
<h3>The benefits of first responder cell boosters</h3>
<p>With a first responder cellular booster, first responders actually have several applications for which they can use this equipment:</p>
<p>It’s no secret that cell phone towers have greatly improved cell phone coverage across the country. But still, first responders might get weak signals depending where they are, the size of the building they’re in, or even obstacles within the building. One way to improve coverage is with a portable first responder booster. These boosters can overcome interference and can strengthen signals so they can reach cell towers.</p>
<p>First responder cellular boosters can also be used in search-and-rescue missions, which often take place in remote areas where cell signals might be weak. Searchers who are armed with boosters can better coordinate search-and-rescue operations. In situations where time is of the essence, cell boosters can ensure that first responders can spend time searching and helping victims rather than searching for a signal.</p>
<p>There may be times where upgrades like first responder wireless solutions are of even greater importance in the field. During some operations where a mobile command center is set up, it’s of vital importance for first responders to be able to communicate and coordinate a response to emergency situations like fires or natural disasters. With the latest boosters, a response can be successful in a time of crisis.</p>
<p>Another helpful <a href="http://www.rfeconnect.com/use-cases/first-responders/">first responder cellular booster</a> that firefighters and police officers can use is one that’s mounted to a vehicle. If first responders are traveling to an emergency or from an emergency toward a hospital, they can be assured they’ll have a strong signal in their vehicles to make necessary calls. The same vehicle-mounted booster can be applied to boats, snowmobiles, and ATVs if responders are doing search-and-rescue work in remote areas.</p>
<h3>Rely on RFe Connect</h3>
<p>With the latest and greatest commercial cell boosters, first responder communications can always be top-notch. First responders can be in communication when they need to be, no matter what kind of work they’re doing. Improve your first responder team with cellular boosters from RFe Connect.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Going to an emergency call can be intimidating, yet first responders do it every day. Police officers, firefighters, and emergency medical technicians routinely head into unknown buildings with unknown people involved in an unknown situation. This places them at great risk, but they do so knowing that their involvement can save lives.</p>
<p>One of the greatest risks in entering an unknown building is the loss of communications. This can happen for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Out of range: Radios have a fixed range. Cell phones must be within the range of at least one cell tower to receive voice and data signals. To receive a strong cell signal, a cell phone must be within the range of multiple overlapping cell towers so that another cell tower can take over the call as the cell caller moves.</li>
<li>Shielding: Physical obstacles, such as walls, ceilings, and floors can block radio and cell signals. In large buildings, so the physical barriers around stairwells or offices in the center of the building may limit or prevent cell signals from reaching a cell tower.</li>
<li>Interference: Machinery and electronic equipment can create interfering signals that disrupt communications. Cell users even report that clothes dryers and electrical generators creating enough interference to disrupt cell calls.</li>
<li>Damaged equipment: Cell towers and switching centers can be damaged or lose power in natural or manmade disasters. This will reduce cell coverage.</li>
</ul>
<p>During an emergency response, first responder communications are essential. Whether you use cell phones as a primary option for communications or you merely use it for backup communications, maintaining your cell signal is essential on an emergency call.</p>
<p>Here are five applications for first responder cellular boosters:</p>
<h3>Dispatcher First Responder Cellular Booster</h3>
<p>A dispatch center might use cellular telephones as a backup to the radio system. Installing a first responder cellular booster at the dispatch center will ensure that dispatchers always have a strong signal that can reach first responders if they cannot be reached by radio.</p>
<p>This might be particularly useful in a city where cell coverage is normally good, but might be compromised due to bad weather, power outages, or natural disasters. In this situation, people who need assistance would use the normal 911 emergency number to reach the dispatch center.</p>
<p>The dispatcher can then use the radio system, as normal, to reach first responders. However, if the radio system is not working, the dispatcher can use the cellular system. Aided by a cellular booster, the dispatcher should be able to reach the assigned cell phones of first responders.</p>
<p>By using cellular service as a backup system, a municipality can maintain contact with first responders even when their radio system goes down. This ensures that first responders are always in communication with dispatchers.</p>
<h3>Portable First Responder Cellular Booster</h3>
<p>Although additional cell towers have improved coverage, nearly 75% of cellular users who make phone calls indoors experience dropped calls and slow download speeds. Depending on the location of the building, size of the building, and position within the building, emergency responders might have no signal or a weak signal.</p>
<p>Selecting the right first responder wireless services might improve coverage. However, one way to reduce the chances of losing cell signal is to provide portable first responder cellular boosters. These can overcome shielding and interference inside buildings. Moreover, if towers have been damaged or are out of range, a first responder cellular booster might strengthen the signal so it can reach a live tower.</p>
<p>Another use of portable first responder cellular boosters is for search and rescue operations in undeveloped areas. In these areas, cell coverage might be weak. Providing first responder cellular boosters to searchers can help coordinate a search and rescue operation. It can also ensure that searchers do not also become victims that need rescuing.</p>
<p>For example, each search team could be outfitted with first responder wireless solutions that include cell phones and a cellular booster. This will enable the team to remain in communication with the search coordinator and other search and rescue assets such as helicopters and vehicle teams.</p>
<h3>Mobile Command Center First Responder Cellular Booster</h3>
<p>During an operation, a mobile command center can be critically important for both commanding and coordinating an emergency response. Whether the emergency is a terrorist attack, natural disaster, or search and rescue, keeping commanders and intelligence in communication can make a response successful.</p>
<p>Operating inside cities can pose particular difficulties because buildings can block cell signals and the flood of radio signals can create interference. In urban operations, a cell booster can ensure that voice and data signals used for command and coordination can cut through the cacophony and reach a cell tower clearly.</p>
<p>For example, during a large urban operation, such as a collapsed building, a mobile command center might be essential to coordinate all the first responders. Without a mobile command center, clearing the building might take much longer than necessary and risk the lives of both victims and responders.</p>
<p>Operations in a rural environment can provide different challenges. Cell coverage might be spotty and a cell booster might give commanders more options for locating a mobile command center while remaining in contact with first responders.</p>
<p>Similarly, during a natural disaster, cell towers might be lost. For example, during a hurricane or earthquake, cell towers might be damaged or lose electricity. Being able to boost commanders&#8217; cell signals with a first responder cell booster can put commanders in the middle of the action both physically and electronically.</p>
<h3>Vehicle-Mounted First Responder Cellular Booster</h3>
<p>A vehicle-mounted cellular booster can boost cell signals for first responders when they are in or near the vehicle. This provides a distinct advantage for first responders while they are traveling to or from an emergency or when they are near their vehicles at an emergency.</p>
<p>For example, if first responders use cell communications as a backup for radio communications, a cell booster in the vehicle might be necessary to reach them when the radio system goes down. In other words, a cell booster at the dispatch center is useless if the first responders cannot receive the call. Thus, first responder cell boosters in the vehicles might be necessary to reach the police, EMTs, or firefighters needed for an emergency call.</p>
<p>Similarly, during a search and rescue operation, cell boosters mounted on all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), boats, or snowmobiles can be essential to keeping searchers in contact with command and control. The benefit of vehicle-mounted cell boosters is that they can be heavier and can be connected to larger batteries than portable cell boosters. This allows them to operate longer without charging or even allows them to be charged from the vehicle&#8217;s electrical system.</p>
<p>Vehicle-mounted cell boosters can also help keep first responders in contact in conditions where cell phones often fail to work. For example, tunnels, underground parking garages, and waterways often have weak cell signals. Mounting cell boosters on vehicles, like cars, trucks, ambulances, boats, motorcycles, fire trucks, or other first responder vehicles can ensure they have cell communication wherever they go.</p>
<h3>Government Headquarters Cellular Booster</h3>
<p>The seat of government is essential during an emergency. If the mayor, city council, county commissioner, or governor cannot reach command and control, the response could be ineffective. Providing a cellular booster at the emergency response center for the local government can help keep the government in communication with first responders.</p>
<p>Equally importantly, the government will be able to communicate with residents. This will assist with alerts, evacuations, or other instructions that the government needs to send to locals. Alerts can be sent directly to residents or posted on social media. These alerts can help keep residents out of harm&#8217;s way and reduce the risk to first responders by containing the emergency.</p>
<p>For example, during a wildfire, the government can alert residents to the location and direction of the fire, order residents to evacuate, and direct them to safety, all using cellular communications. A cellular booster at city hall, the county offices, or the state capitol, the government can reach residents, social media, and other communication outlets to keep residents informed and safe.</p>
<p>Cellular communications can be critically important during an emergency for first responders, command and control, and government officials. By providing <a href="http://www.rfeconnect.com/use-cases/first-responders/">first responder cellular booster</a>s at the locations where they will be needed, a government can reduce the risk that the first responders will be out of communication. This will improve the response to the emergency situation and enable the first responders to save lives and property.</p>
