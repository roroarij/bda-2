										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We live in a world that relies on various wireless technologies to communicate with one another. For the general consumer, infrastructure elements such as strong cellular, radio, and Wi-Fi signals have moved beyond being a luxury into a matter of safety and security. Radio and cellular signals are often weakened in large buildings and other venues due to a variety of factors, such as radio frequency interference, low-emissivity glass, concrete, and other building materials. These obstacles create areas within the structure that have little-to-no signal, rendering radios and cellular phones useless. Not only is this a source of frustration for building occupants, but it also interferes with the communication of first responders in cases of emergency. However, there are ways to mitigate these issues. Distributed Antenna Systems (DAS) improve connectivity for occupants, and newer building codes, such as Emergency Responder Radio Coverage (ERRC), address communication for Police, Fire, and other emergency personnel.</p>
<h2>The History of DAS</h2>
<p>A distributed antenna system, or DAS, is a dedicated antennae network that allows personal cellular signals to be sent and received within a building, hospital, hotel, or other large venues. It typically uses a carrier’s licensed frequencies and greatly improves voice and data connectivity for occupants inside these structures. Initially, cellular service was considered an exclusive agreement between the service provider and the properties that utilized their DAS frequencies. This was problematic for inhabitants that used a different provider, as they did not have access to a signal strong enough to provide reliable service. Another concern for those who lived or worked in taller buildings was that cellular signals weaken as the distance between a user and the signal increases. However, the evolution of these systems has made them more streamlined, allowing demarcation points to shift from property lines and MDF rooms to individual offices and/or units, thereby strengthening connectivity. Best practices for effective DAS design and application have been set forth by the Building Industry Consulting Services International (BICSI) and the Telecommunications Industry Association. DAS requirements remain stringent for government buildings and hotels; however multi-family Owners and Developers are able to utilize alternative methods, such as Wi-Fi and Emergency Responder Radio Coverage (ERRC), to maintain adequate signal strength to ensure safety of building tenants and staff.</p>
<h2>DAS and Wi-Fi</h2>
<p>Innovations in wireless technology have allowed Wi-Fi to add additional communication options to the architecture, engineering, and construction industries. It’s becoming an increasingly popular alternative to trusting cellular networks alone and can usually be found in common areas of multifamily properties, college campuses, as well as conference rooms and offices. While Wi-Fi is a viable alternative to cellular signals, it can still fail if a user’s signal is weak. That failure can quickly become dangerous if that user is a first responder. In 2018, new requirements were initiated to strengthen wireless connectivity inside buildings, ensuring that communication would be available when wanted and, more importantly, when needed.</p>
<h2>The Rise of ERRC</h2>
<p>Emergency Responder Radio Coverage (ERRC) refers to the code requirements surrounding radio strength within a building. It is similar to DAS but utilizes different frequencies and legalities. Its main purpose is to help firefighters, police officers, and paramedics establish points of operation and communication, allowing them to respond to emergencies within buildings. While it is possible to use ERRC in place of a DAS or Wi-Fi connectivity, it is inadvisable to do so. ERRC is intended to run on one antenna using one frequency. Adding additional frequencies for non-emergency communication is cost-prohibitive, making a DAS or Wi-Fi a better option for everyday communication.</p>
<p>Before ERRC was developed, emergency personnel often wasted valuable time and resources finding an outdoor location with a signal strong enough to support their radio communication both inside and outside a given building. ERRC not only regulates the signal strength, it includes software with graphics for police, firefighters, and medics to track and monitor where personnel are located while onsite. However, despite these valuable benefits to first responders, these types of systems present specific design challenges that are best piloted by Federal Communications Commission (FCC)-licensed partners both because of their cost and safety implications.</p>
<p>Equipment needs for adequate service can vary because the strength of a signal inside a building can differ based on a number of factors, including what the building is made from or its proximity to a cell tower. Some projects may not need any additional equipment to boost signal strength. Other projects located in areas where cell towers are less prevalent or perhaps made from different building materials might require a more detailed system to support a signal strong enough for the safety of occupants and first responders. Also, installation costs can vary by manufacturer and location, potentially resulting in higher-than-expected initial expenses.</p>
<h2>Code Updates and Their Impact</h2>
<p>The importance of improving indoor connectivity for first responders came to light after the release of the Post-9/11 Commission Report in 2005. Before this, fire fighters relied upon phone jacks installed near stairways for communication indoors with personnel in the building’s fire control room. While having adequate radio signals indoors renders the jacks unnecessary, building codes still require them to be installed unless exempted by the respective fire marshal. In many cases, fire marshals need to be educated on ERRC applications and prevalence in contrast to what has been done in the past.</p>
<p>Subsequent building code updates have been enacted to ensure proper indoor signal strength for both new and existing buildings. While these new codes are determined by authorities having jurisdiction (AHJ) and can sometimes be county-driven, fire code officials are in charge of approving the system and frequencies. An FCC-issued General Radio Operator’s License (GROL) is required, as well as training and OEM Certification or skill satisfactory to the AHJ. Emergency generators need two hours of battery backup under this updated code, and if there is no emergency generator, 12 hours of battery backup are required. There are also minimum requirements for inbound and outbound signals’ delivered audio quality.</p>
<p>In the most recent version of the IFC code, signal boosters and system monitoring protocols were revised, including:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Battery systems for emergency power must be housed in NEMA 3R cabinets.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Any donor antenna must be isolated from interior antennae no less than 20dB greater than the system gain under all operating conditions.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Installing system amplifiers, or any system that might interfere with an ERRC system, must be coordinated and approved by the fire code official.</li>
<li aria-level="1">ERRC systems must be monitored by a fire alarm control unit or sound an audible alarm, as approved by a fire code official.</li>
<li aria-level="1">There should also be automatic signals for any of the following: loss of AC power supply, battery charge and RF-emitting device failures, antenna malfunctions, failure of critical system components, and for communication links between the fire alarm system and the emergency responder radio enhancement system.</li>
</ul>
<p>In regard to existing buildings without an approved communication system, one can be installed within a timeframe established by the AHJ. While it’s the building Owner’s responsibility to adhere to the code and meet annual recertification requirements, project partners can provide plans to help meet code requirements. System integrators must design and install ERRC systems using FCC-certified equipment in NEMA-4 enclosures. Signal testing falls under the responsibility of the Owner, integrator, and often the third party and is required to be completed annually.</p>
<p>According to the current code, a building’s ERRC system must cover at least 95% of public safety frequencies, and contractors that provide the designs and installation of ERRC systems must be licensed by the FCC.</p>
<h2>The Cost of Lacking Coverage</h2>
<p>ERRC and DAS can be retroactively implemented for existing buildings; however, the time, resources, and coordination to do so can complicate the process for many Owners and Developers. Fire marshals can bring a project to a halt during the final stages if signal strength standards are not fully met. If you leave these systems out of the planning and design phases of a project, one risks incurring additional expenses and subsequently rushing other phases of construction to stay on task. Retrofitting ERRC and DAS systems during or after construction often results in higher rates from project partners, due to an increase in the amount of coordination and materials needed to modify signal strength and coverage. For example, cables for emergency generators typically cost less than one dollar, but the price can rise to six times that amount for out-of-sequence system construction. In the near future, building codes will require annual signal strength testing, which will shrink the margin of error for system planning and implementation. When this update takes effect, it is best addressed by seasoned partners who can expertly plan and design communication systems, as well as coordinate signal strength testing efficiently.</p>
<h2>Closing</h2>
<p>DAS and Wi-Fi connectivity are highly technical systems and require experienced project partners to ensure that best practices are being adhered to. ERRC systems for emergency responders require coordination with FCC-licensed partners, code compliance, and extraordinary attention to detail.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What’s the difference between passive and active distributed antenna systems (DAS)? We hear this question a lot in our field. To put it simply, a distributed antenna system, or DAS, is a clustered installation of antennas to boost cellular network coverage in areas with weak signal.</p>
<h2>ACTIVE DAS</h2>
<p>Active DAS simply means the components require a power source to operate. Building owners, property managers, and enterprise customers have a number of options when there’s a cellular coverage problem. Traditionally, so-called Active Distributed Antenna Systems (DAS) were the only alternative for many customers. These systems are expensive and take months to deploy, although for customers with capacity issues (think football stadium or airport) it is the preferred solution. Permission to connect to a carrier network is often a long, time-consuming process. For each additional carrier, the process has to be repeated each time.</p>
<p>Active DAS solutions are costly and can take several months up to a year to install. As a rule of thumb, any high-traffic building over 500,000 sq. ft. needing complete wall-to-wall coverage should consider Active DAS.</p>
<h2>PASSIVE DAS</h2>
<p>Passive DAS systems tend to use passive components like coaxial cable, splitters, and diplexers to distribute signal, and unlike active DAS, they use bi-directional amplifiers to re-broadcast signal from a macro cellular network using either an over-the-air donor antenna or a “small cell” from each carrier. This means that Passive DAS heavily rely on adequate signal from a nearby cell tower – a great solution for urban areas.</p>
<p>For a complete Passive DAS installation, the total cost is greatly less expensive than Active DAS and the time required installing ranges from days to a few weeks or months.</p>
<h2>THE BOTTOM LINE</h2>
<p>As a general rule, Passive DAS is the best choice for buildings up to 100,000 square feet, but can also be scaled upwards to 500,000 square feet. A Passive DAS is much more cost-effective and can provide appropriate cellular coverage in most commercial buildings.</p>
<p>Active DAS need be employed in complex, sprawling high-traffic areas like airports, stadiums, convention centers, and other structures over 500,000 square feet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For facilities managers, building owners and architects, building wireless solutions should be front of mind to ensure the best enterprise connectivity options available.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of course, there are situations, where clients are unfamiliar with solutions other than Wi-Fi, or concern over building wireless complexity vs. Wi-Fi simplicity causes hesitation. However, most enterprise networks will need the advanced level of connectivity support that IBW provides, rather than Wi-Fi alone.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As wireless companies continue to bombard building owners with 5G advertisements, building owners are left attempting to make sense of what the best wireless solution is for their building.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">From an engineer’s perspective, deploying IBW is simpler than ever before. For the client, it’s also much easier to gain guidance on what IBW solution would best suit their unique requirements (DAS? Small cell? Single-operator, multi-operator, high-power, low-power, etc), and to receive the support needed to implement and manage the right solution.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Regardless of the IBW solution adopted however, there are typically similar steps involved in deployment – that both engineers and their clients should be aware of and understand for seamless implementation.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">STEP 1: SCHEDULE A MEETING TO DETERMINE OVERALL REQUIREMENTS FOR YOUR DESIGN</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">With our company, our first step is to meet with you to better understand your needs and discuss the requirements for the WLAN. During this meeting, we will discuss the requirements and capacity for your building, as well as your security needs. If you don’t have all the answers, don’t worry. In fact, many people don’t. That’s why we’re here: to help you understand and guide you through the process.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">STEP 2: WE WILL SURVEY THE SITE</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For existing buildings, a site survey should be conducted to evaluate the signal quality of the different mobile operators and to identify optimum installation locations for radio remote units and antennas. This will require access to building floor plans and the use of site survey tools that can test for signal quality and RF interference.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A provisional RF design is recommended for buildings that are still under construction. The building construction and design team should prepare a preliminary RF design to be included with the initial building plans. A provisional RF design can provide a best estimation of RF penetration based on the structure, materials and floor plan of the building.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">STEP 3: INSTALLATION AND DEPLOYMENT</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our installation engineers are held to the highest standards and are committed to producing a high quality DAS system. We will never compromise the quality of our work, but will always finish on time and on budget.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Having established your blueprint for your DAS project, it then becomes time to put your plan into action and begin installation. Here are the basic steps we will go through for a successful installation.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">End-to-end DAS installation</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Full construction management</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Head-end equipment installation and testing.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">System optimization and acceptance testing.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Macro network optimization.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Public safety compliance and coordination.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Building wireless solutions are always evolving, and are now more affordable, versatile and easier to install than ever before; great news for enterprise environments, who increasingly need to ensure high quality, continuous connectivity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of course, this is also great news for infrastructure professionals and those who maintain the right wireless training, will be best placed to stay ahead of the curve in an evolving and expanding market. If you are looking for more information regarding small cell DAS solutions, please contact us today!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Police two-way radios are essential pieces of equipment, to protect citizens as well as the officers themselves from harm. Public safety, police, firefighters, EMTs and emergency-response professionals know the essentials of two-way radio use because it’s so central to their work.</span></p>
<h2 class="p2"><span class="s1">What Is An ERRCS?</span></h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">An emergency responder radio communication systems is an extension of the public safety radio network based on RF performance. An ERRCS improves in-building coverage for voice communications, and is beneficial to first responders by reaching poor signal areas affected by factors like Low-E glass, interior/exterior walls, interior clutter, external obstructions, and more.</span></p>
<h2 class="p2"><span class="s1">What Does an ERRCS System Look Like?</span></h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An ERRCS looks much like an Over-the-Air Cellular DAS in some respects: it uses a donor antenna to receive the radio signals from the local first responder network – signals that operate on private frequencies. These signals are then re-amplified in the building at the required locations. This communication system is best for when you need to ensure that first responders can maintain wireless communications within a building structure in emergency situations.</span></p>
<h2 class="p2"><span class="s1">The Answer in Emergency Situations</span></h2>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The Columbine school shooting in 1999 marked one of the first times where easy access to cell phones played a role in a major emergency. Unfortunately, students could call newscasters, but could not convey accurate information, creating conflicting reports that confused first responders. And 911 dispatchers were flooded with calls, which did more harm than good. That frustrating scene of over-strained cellular networks has become familiar in such disasters as the attack on 9/11 and Hurricane Sandy.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">PTT over cell phones excel because they have dedicated bandwidth and a limited number of users.</span> <span class="s1">With the addition of bi-directional amplifiers, distributed antenna systems, and repeaters, reliable two-way radio coverage can be extended throughout a facility or across a campus in areas where cell phone signals cannot reach.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Effective, fast communication is absolutely vital for law enforcement officers and the personnel who support them. Whether you need a brand new communications setup or some accessories for your existing system, our experts can handle all of your agency’s needs. We design code compliant ERRCs, and assist with coming up with a realistic projection of systems cost before your construction begins.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ever wonder whether your building needs to improve its wireless connection? If you are struggling with poor signal and lost connection, you should look into an In-Building Wireless Solution right away for the safety of all those who enter your building. It is required in every building that you are able to communicate well, for safety reasons. If you are unable to do so in your building currently, we would love to help you improve that by finding a solution that is right for you.</p>
<p>Start by asking yourself these three questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>When inside your building, do you or your customers suffer from dropped calls, poor signals, &amp; lost connection?</li>
<li>When stepping outside, do the problems that you were struggling with inside the building seem to go away?</li>
<li>Are you receiving text, email, or call notifications several hours after they were sent?</li>
</ol>
<p>If your answer was ‘Yes’ to the above questions, We are here to assist you. We will help you understand your requirements, safety, and building codes and get you on the right track to improving your wireless connection.</p>
<h2>REQUEST A SITE-SURVEY</h2>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Without one or more site surveys, it is impossible to determine whether all or only some part of a building actually needs an ERRCS.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Site surveys provide baseline readings of the signal strength at the property – assuming the property is in some stage of construction. This will allow for a preliminary evaluation of the possible need for an ERRCS so that horizontal and vertical cable paths and/or conduits can be identified and installed. Once the building’s outer skin is up, a second site survey will determine the necessity of the ERRCS and identify areas of the building that require a network of antennas. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Emergency First Responders use portable radio systems when navigating through the neighborhoods and hazardous area conditions caused by fire. Having the proper forms of communication and the advanced signal connection can be a life-saving tool for a Firefighter on duty. Large commercial buildings require a more advanced ERRCs system to be installed for this reason alone.</p>
<p class="p1">The radio system firefighters communicate on is called an LMRs. It is essential that these radios work properly no matter where a first responder may be so that if they are calling out for help, they will be heard. In large commercial buildings, high-rise or underground buildings, sometimes this signal can be inhibited due to the construction features on the building. When this is the case, property owners are required to put in a more advanced, two-way form of the communication system.</p>
<p class="p1">One way to help with this signal interruption is by installing a distributed antenna system that provides an RF signal to a portable radio, such as the LMRs, within the building. According to the Fire Rescue Magazine, “At the head-end of the DAS, a base station or repeater provides the signal. The main hub takes that signal, digitizes it, and distributes it to other hubs and radios via a high-bandwidth fiber-optic network. At each remote hub, the device converts the signals from digital to RF and from RF to digital and distributes the RF signal over the distributed antenna covering a portion of a building.” By doing so, the DAS is able to then transport the mobile signal at an advanced strength to any remote antenna connected.</p>
<p class="p1">Interior Emergency Radio Communication Systems should be taken seriously. They can be cost-effective and reliable tools for when firefighters are communicating during emergency situations. By installing this two-way communication system in your building, you are enhancing the communication capabilities for all involved, in case an emergency did take place.</p>

Contact us for a quote today Ada learn how we ca help your building with our cellular enhancement. </h3>


<p class="p1">Cellular DAS is a great way to improve your in-building wireless connection and ensure that you are never left without a signal no matter where you are in your building. Often times, construction materials can interfere with the wireless connection, producing frequent dropped calls and low signal radio frequencies. You should be able to use your phone, computer, or iPad in any room of the building. Cellular DAS can allow that to happen. Here are four reasons why we recommend having us set up a Cellular Distributed Antenna System in your building.</p>
<h2 class="p1">UNINTERRUPTED CONNECTION</h2>
<p class="p1">Avoid losing signal in the middle of your business calls. Cellular antennas will be placed inside the building rather than outside to make sure that you receive full network strength with unbreakable communication lines.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<h2 class="p1">YOU CAN CONNECT MULTIPLE CARRIERS</h2>
<p class="p1">One of the great benefits of using cellular DAS is that you will be able to receive network strength from multiple carrier networks spread out throughout your building. This will make your customers happy as they will not have to worry about a poor signal when waiting in your lobby.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<h2 class="p1">GREAT COVERAGE</h2>
<p class="p1">As was previously mentioned above, the nice thing about using cellular DAS is that you can place the antennas where you would like them to be throughout your building to allow you the ability to receive additional signal coverage. Perhaps you would like a signal in your basement or parking garage. The options are endless when you choose us for your Wireless Cellular DAS Solutions.</p>
<h2 class="p1">EXCELLENT SPEED</h2>
<p class="p1">The fourth benefit we would like to mention is that this solution will help improve your network speed overall. This means that you will be able to quickly respond to customers in a timely manner. Not only will this save you time, but it will also allow your customers to receive excellent service from your business. It’s a win-win situation.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>How Cellular Antennas Affect the Power of a Signal Booster System</h2>
<p>Cellular antennas represent two of the three essential pieces of a signal booster system, so you’d better believe they can affect the power and performance of the system. Each antenna adds a different element to the equation and picking the right set of antennas can be almost as important as choosing the right booster.</p>
<p><strong>There are five factors under your control which determine the output power of your signal booster system:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Gain of outdoor antenna</li>
<li>Cable run loss between outdoor antenna and signal amplifier</li>
<li>Gain of signal amplifier</li>
<li>Cable run loss between signal amplifier and indoor antenna</li>
<li>Gain of indoor antenna</li>
</ul>
<p>So, even though the amplifier will do most of the heavy lifting, it’s possible to add some serious kick to your system with the right cellular antennas. This can be especially useful in areas where your signal is weak.</p>
<h2>What an Outdoor Cellular Antenna Does, and How to Use Them</h2>
<p>An outdoor (or donor) cellular antenna captures existing signal on the cellular bandwidths and attaches to a cellular signal booster for amplification. These antennas are usually wideband, with a 4G cellular antenna capturing any signal in its radiation pattern between the 698-2700 MHz range (broken into 698-960 MHz and 1710-2700 MHz ranges, specifically).</p>
<p>Donor antennas are the first major piece of a signal booster system and are usually the most difficult to set up properly. This is due to several factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>They need to be set up in the area with the strongest cell signal for best performance. This is usually on the roof of the building.</li>
<li>Many require precise aiming. This applies solely to directional antennas, with Yagi antennas being easier to aim than LPDAs. They need to be aimed toward a cell tower near you.</li>
<li>They need proper cabling, and that cabling needs to run indoors to your signal amplifier.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first and third steps above apply to all outdoor antennas, but the second will vary depending on your outdoor antenna type.</p>
<h2>Yagi Antennas: The Old Reliable</h2>
<div class="blog-modern-product-box">

<p class="blurb">Wide-band directional antenna with up to 9.2 dBi</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Yagi antenna (also known as a Yagi-Uda antenna) was invented in 1926 by Japanese inventors Shintaro Uda and Hidetsugu Yagi. Since then, they have played a major role in RF transmission around the world. Improving cellular signal is one of the most common uses of a Yagi antenna and this article will specifically cover cellular Yagi antennas. Here’s an interesting article covering <a href="https://www.dxzone.com/the-true-story-of-yagi-antenna/">the history of Yagi-Uda antennas</a>. Otherwise, let’s get going.</p>
<h3>What is a Yagi Antenna?</h3>
<p>A Yagi antenna is a directional antenna that <strong>improves radiation in a single direction</strong>, and such radiation can be either transmission or reception of energy, such as cell signal.</p>
<h3>What is a Yagi Antenna Used For?</h3>
<p>Yagi antennas have different purposes. At an industrial level, they can work for radars to detect movement or for ham radio. At a consumer level, they can be used to enhance Over-The-Air television reception and, nowadays, <strong>cellular Yagi antennas can boost cell signal at home or at work</strong> where remote areas struggle to ensure quality in telecommunications. However, we don’t recommend using them to boost cell signal in your vehicle. We will explain why in a moment.</p>
<h3>How Does a Yagi Antenna Work?</h3>
<p>A Yagi antenna works through the interaction of four essential pieces:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Driven Element:</strong> The driven element of a Yagi is the point where the feed line is attached from the transmitter to the Yagi to perform the transfer of power from the transmitter to the antenna.</li>
<li><strong>Director(s):</strong> Used to provide the antenna with directional power and gain.</li>
<li><strong>Line:</strong> The spine of the antenna used to hold the directors and reflectors and connect to the driven element.</li>
<li><strong>Reflector:</strong> Used to reject signal outside its range as well as amplify what’s inside &#8211; think of a mirror reflecting light.</li>
</ol>
<p>These pieces allow Y<strong>agi antennas to achieve higher gain than omnidirectional antennas.</strong></p>
<p>They don’t perform well in a vehicle, as driving or sailing creates a constant change of direction. However, the directional nature of a Yagi makes it ideal for home and commercial installations, as it allows for greater gain and reach.</p>
<h3>Is a Yagi Antenna Directional?</h3>
<p>Yes. To be exact, a Yagi antenna is unidirectional, and that’s the main feature when improving cell signal: it aims to <strong>maximize the reception of signal from a particular carrier</strong> in just one direction.</p>
<h3>How Far Can a Yagi Antenna Reach?</h3>
<p>A typical Yagi is effective up to 5 miles – but generally speaking will work best up to around 3. If you’re seeking to amplify cell signal, Yagi antennas come with either 50 or 75 ohm configurations, depending on the use case of your system (commercial or consumer usage). <strong>Yagi antennas are three times more powerful than omnidirectional antennas</strong> because they are frequency-specific, work with one or two carriers, and can be placed to reach the best possible signal wherever you are.</p>
<h3>How Do I Aim a Yagi Antenna?</h3>
<p>You should aim the outdoor antenna <strong>in the direction that best receives the signal from your carrier</strong> because a Yagi antenna will not receive any signal that is out of the direction they point to. In other words, if your carrier is out of the beam of the antenna, you won’t receive the boost you’re looking for. Thus, we recommend finding your nearest cell tower before pointing your yagi antenna.</p>
<h2>Omnidirectional Antennas: The Simple Setup</h2>
<div class="blog-modern-product-box">

</div>
</div>
<p>Omnidirectional (or omni) cellular antennas pull in signal from all directions. Cellular omnidirectional antennas are common sights in low-lying areas, or attached to the sides of commercial buildings. While omnidirectional antennas exist for all sorts of RF, this article will focus on cellular.</p>
<h3>What is an Omnidirectional Antenna Used For?</h3>
<p>Omnidirectional antennas are the most useful for multi-carrier setups and are far easier to install than other outdoor options. They pull in all existing signal in an area. This has several advantages, but also a few disadvantages.</p>
<p>There are three major advantages to omnidirectional antennas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy installation</li>
<li>Will amplify all cell signal in your area, from multiple carriers with different cell towers in multiple locations</li>
<li>Superb in strong signal areas and low-lying valleys</li>
</ul>
<p>However, they also have some disadvantages when compared to Yagi and LPDA antennas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t reach as far as a directional antenna</li>
<li>Don’t give as much gain to your incoming signal as a directional antenna</li>
<li>Susceptible to “signal noise” and can become overwhelmed in extremely busy urban areas</li>
<li>Not optimized for rural areas where distance from the cell tower is the main problem</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also some physical limitations to omnidirectional antennas that warrant bearing in mind.</p>
<p>All that said, omnidirectional antennas work extremely well in strong-to-middling strength signal areas, and, when paired with a powerful enough amplifier, are more than equipped to do a great job.</p>
<h2>Cellular Log-Periodic Dipole Array (LPDA) Antenna: The Highest Power</h2>
<div class="blog-modern-product-box">
<div class="image"><img decoding="async" class="lazyautosizes lazyloaded" src="https://www.wilsonamplifiers.com/product_images/uploaded_images/wilson-lpda-antenna.png" sizes="227px" alt="High Gain LPDA Antenna - 311228" data-sizes="auto" data-src="/product_images/uploaded_images/wilson-lpda-antenna.png" /></div>
<div class="details">High Gain LPDA Antenna &#8211; 311228</p>
<p class="blurb">Powerful directional antenna with up to 13.1 dBi</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Log-periodic antennas are known by many names: LPDA (short for log-periodic dipole array), log-periodic dipole antenna, log-periodic aerial, or just a log-periodic array. They have a simple job: <strong>to operate over a wide band of radio frequencies</strong>. What these frequencies bandwidths are vary based on the type of log periodic antenna you buy.</p>
<p>They’re more common than you might think. You’ve probably noticed log periodic antennas in passing all your life, sitting atop suburban and rural rooftops, poking out on apartment balconies. Traditionally, log periodic antennas have been used for analog television, which was the dominant style until digital eclipsed and replaced it in the recent past. Even still, they remain used in many areas, and, as a quick search for a TV antenna will show you, they continue to dominate that market.</p>
<p>The reason for this is simple: they <strong>have excellent range and can cover a wide range of broadband frequencies</strong>. Their directivity allows them to have a narrower focus than their cousins the Yagi antenna, which <strong>gives them increased power over their brethren</strong>. Properly installed, they will work in fringe areas Yagi&#8217;s just can’t.</p>
<h3>How Do Log Periodic Dipole Array (LDPA) Antennas Work?</h3>
<p>Log periodic antennas (hereafter referred to as ‘LPDA’ or ‘LPDAs’) normally consist of half-wave dipole elements each consisting of a pair of metal rods positioned along a support boom lying along the antenna axis. The spacing of these elements are what allow for the tuning of the frequency range of the LPDA &#8211; meaning, cellular LPDAs are finely tuned in such a way as to pick up cellular frequencies between the 698-2700 MHz frequencies. Other LPDA antennas focus on <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/personal-radio-services-prs-keeping-touch">VHF</a>, <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/public-safety/uhfvhf-bands">UH</a>F, WiFi, <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-opens-6-ghz-band-wi-fi-and-other-unlicensed-uses">and other wavelengths in the high frequency GHz spectrum</a>.</p>
<p>LPDA antennas are contrasted with <a href="https://interferencetechnology.com/emc-antenna-parameters-and-their-relationships/">EMC antennas</a>, which operate electromagnetically, and <a href="https://www.antenna-theory.com/arrays/main.php">array antennas</a>, which are big, complicated arrays of numerous antennas that can both transmit and receive. LPDAs are significantly more diverse in their usage &#8211; they can operate off standard power and can be installed just about anywhere at not too great of a cost.</p>
<p>LPDA antennas <strong>focus on antenna gain</strong> (measured in dBi). While a Yagi or omni antenna focuses on bringing in signal within relatively close environs, the LPDA can work adequately in fringe conditions. This is accomplished with a relatively focused radiation pattern, at a roughly 30-degree beamwidth.</p>
<p>A radiation pattern with such high gain and wide bandwidth is achieved by creating a three-element Yagi antenna. These are called <strong>driven elements</strong>, connected electrically to the feedline. This feedline &#8211; usually coaxial cable, but sometimes twin-lead or ladder line &#8211; zig zags between the dipole elements. Certain LPDAs are known as <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US3355740">log-periodic zig zag antennas</a> because they replace the dipoles with the feedline itself.</p>
<h2>Yagi vs. Omni vs. LPDA: Which Cellular Antenna is Best for Me?</h2>
<p>There are a few major differences between the three major cellular antennas (Yagi, omni, and LPDAs), all of which have been hinted at above.</p>
<h3>How They Are the Same</h3>
<p>Omnidirectional antennas, Yagi antennas, and LPDAs pull in existing cellular signal (5G, 5G E, 4G LTE, and 3G, depending on the bandwidths covered by the antenna). All of them increase the power of the signal upon pulling it in, but the extent to which that happens varies depending on the type.</p>
<h3>How They Differ</h3>
<p>Omni antennas are the standard antenna type. They catch signal <strong>in a 360-degree field, and do not discriminate</strong>. They will seize any cellular signal that exists, whether you want it or not. This is great if you have several cell sites nearby, since you can easily multiple carriers at once. Omni-directional antennas nearly always look like rod shaped cylinders. Think of a radio antenna you might have on your car &#8211; this is an omni antenna.</p>
<p>The main disadvantage of an omni antenna is its power. Due to its 360-degree radiation pattern, both its range and overall dBi gain are lower than directional antennas.</p>
<p>However, this disadvantage comes with some very real perks: <strong>omni antennas are ideal for multi-carrier setups in strong outside signal environments</strong>. Many of our corporate clients prefer omni antennas, because they usually must service multiple carriers (AT&amp;T, Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile, etc.) inside their buildings.</p>
<p>Although it’s plausible for two T-Mobile or any other same-carrier towers to be close enough to each other that the omni-antenna pulls in signal from both, it&#8217;s most likely a rare situation. Depending on the location, you’ll most likely be close to one of each carrier tower (i.e., one AT&amp;T tower, one T-Mobile, one Verizon tower, etc., not two AT&amp;T towers, three T-Mobile towers, one Verizon, etc.).</p>
<p>That’s where an LPDA or Yagi antenna come in. These are more specialized, with Yagi antennas being more general use than LPDAs. Their <strong>directionality allows for longer range and higher gain</strong>, with the LPDA being more directional than the Yagi. This directionality allows for more precise and powerful signal to reach your amplifier.</p>
<p>The <strong>more remote you are, the more directional you’ll want to think</strong>. Conversely, if you’re in an extremely urban area and are bombarded with irrelevant signal, becoming more directional can help with that, too.</p>
<h3>Which Outdoor Antenna Gives the Highest Gain?</h3>
<p><strong>Log-periodic dipole array (LPDA) antennas</strong> give the highest gain in almost every situation. LPDA antennas have longer range and higher gain than Yagi and omnidirectional antennas <strong>but are harder to aim and very directional</strong>. However, these are far and away your <strong>best option in rural or weak signal areas</strong>.</p>
<h2>What an Indoor Cellular Antenna Does, and How to Use Them</h2>
<p>Indoor cellular antennas are the piece which <strong>broadcasts the cellular signal captured by outdoor antennas in buildings</strong>. Like outdoor antennas, they come in two varieties: panel and dome.</p>
<p>Panel and dome antennas get their name from their shape, which plays a role in how they operate. The dome shape allows the antenna to broadcast the boosted signal in every direction, making it a type of omni-directional antenna. A panel antenna only broadcasts signals in one direction, making it a directional antenna.</p>
<p>These need to be <strong>placed where you most desire signal</strong>. The closer you are to the radiation pattern of the indoor antenna, the stronger your signal will be. This directly affects the coverage area of your signal booster system.</p>
<h2>Panel Antennas: Versatility and Power</h2>
<div class="blog-modern-product-box">
<div class="image"><img decoding="async" class="lazyautosizes lazyloaded" src="https://www.wilsonamplifiers.com/product_images/uploaded_images/wilson-indoor-panel-antenna.png" sizes="206px" alt="Wilson Panel Antenna - 311135" data-sizes="auto" data-src="/product_images/uploaded_images/wilson-indoor-panel-antenna.png" /></div>
<div class="details">Panel Antenna &#8211; 311135</p>
<p class="blurb">Popular in-building directional antenna with up to 10.6 dBi</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The majority of weBoost signal booster kits by RFeCommunications use panel antennas. They are wall-mounted and send signals in a directional cone ranging from 45 to 70 degrees. Having such a narrow focus allows for stronger signal at the source (i.e. the closer to the panel antenna, the better the signal).</p>
<p>On average, they give 75 feet of coverage. This varies depending on how strong the outside signal is. If there is strong signal outside, there will be more coverage. Weak signal areas will get less.</p>
<p>The reason why panel antennas are generally recommended first is because of inside interference, and their higher gain. Building materials such as metal, concrete, and energy-efficient barriers can disrupt signals from penetrating the building. Once inside with the help of a signal booster, dense walls and other RF-disrupting material (metal, glass, sheetrock, etc.) can equally disturb the signal coming from the inside antenna.</p>
<p>With a panel antenna, you’re able to focus the signal within a specific location in your home or commercial building that needs better signal, such as your living room, home office, or conference room. As a result, the signal being broadcasted in that area will face minimal interference. Every device in that room will receive better signal and faster data first before the signal spreads to lower priority areas.</p>
<p>To improve the signal in the rooms with limited to nonexistent coverage, the panel antenna can be installed right side up or upside down on a wall, and in some cases on a high ceiling. If installed on the ceiling, due to its beamwidth and strength, it can also improve the signal in the lower levels of your house or commercial building. However, the signal won’t be as strong in the lower levels as it is in the room where the antenna is located because the building materials it must travel through interferes with the signal’s strength.</p>

<p>Dome antennas are ceiling-mounted and broadcast amplified signal 360 degrees horizontally &#8211; think of its broadcasting beam as half a sphere. This provides a wide horizontal spread of coverage to deliver equal signal in every direction.</p>
<p>Depending on your outside signal strength, on average you’ll get about 50 feet of coverage with a dome antenna. Areas with poor cellular service will probably receive much less coverage.</p>
<p>When considering a dome antenna, keep in mind that you’ll need access to a crawl space or attic for proper installation. Thus, they tend to be better for commercial use, one-story homes, or multi-level homes with drop ceilings.</p>
<p>When installed under perfect conditions, meaning low ceilings and zero to minimal inside interference, dome antennas are phenomenal at broadcasting improved 3G, 4G LTE, and 5G signals in large areas.</p>
<p>However, if you have high ceilings (usually 20-30 feet or higher) and thick or numerous walls, then a dome antenna isn’t be recommended, since the signal will weaken the further it travels.</p>
<h2>Dome and Panel Antenna Gain</h2>
<p>Every type of antenna has a certain amount of gain associated with them, measured in dB (decibels). Simply put, gain represents an <a href="https://www.jpole-antenna.com/2014/03/28/antenna-gain-explained/">antenna’s ability to direct the signal</a> it’s broadcasting and how far the signal can travel. Antennas with high gain usually mean they are more directional, which results in more reach. On the other hand, lower gain antennas tend to be the opposite. We’ve covered this in the outdoor antenna section.</p>
<p>Panel antennas, since they are directional, will have more gain and reach than a dome antenna. Our regular dome antennas feature up to +5.1 dB of gain and the low-profile dome antennas feature up to +6 or +7 dB of gain, while the panel antennas tend to feature up to +7.6 dB or up to +10.6 dB of gain.</p>
<p>If you live in an area with weak signal, a higher gain antenna will probably be your best option. This will allow the broadcasted signal to be a tad bit stronger and travel a tad bit further in your home or commercial building than it would with a dome antenna.</p>
<h2>Panel vs. Dome: Which Should I Get?</h2>
<p>A good rule of thumb when trying to choose between dome and panel antennas is to think about:</p>
<ul>
<li>The shape of the area in which you want to boost the signal</li>
<li>What inside interference exists in the area</li>
<li>How much of a priority is coverage in that area</li>
</ul>
<p>Do you have <strong>lots of inside interference</strong> &#8211; thick walls, metal, and glass &#8211; around your home or building? Is there a specific area you want priority service, such as a closed off room or corridor? If you answered yes to any of those questions, then <strong>go with a panel antenna</strong>.</p>
<p>Do you have <strong>open spaces</strong> with virtually no walls, thin walls, or minimal inside interference? Do you want to broadcast an equal amount of signal throughout your home or building? Do you have low ceilings and access to a crawl space or attic? If yes, then <strong>go with a dome antenna</strong>.</p>
<p>Depending on your outside signal strength and the size of your building, it’s entirely possible one antenna will not be enough to provide the coverage you want, especially in multi-level residential or commercial buildings. To maximize your coverage area, you may want to consider getting splitters and a combination of panel and dome antennas. If you decide to purchase additional antennas, make sure their impedance rating of 50 Ohms or 75 Ohms matches that of your signal booster, otherwise, you&#8217;ll need additional connectors and adapters and have more loss.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Other Indoor Antenna Types</h2>
<p>Dome and panel antennas are not the only types of indoor antennas available; they are just the most common. There are two other types of indoor antennas that can be paired with booster systems designed to cover one to two rooms, such as the weBoost Home Studio and the weBoost Home Room.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Terminal Antennas or Whip Antennas</strong> attach directly to the signal amplifier &#8211; similar to a WiFi router’s rubber ducky antenna. They’re omni-directional just like the dome antenna but not as powerful.</li>
<li><strong>Desktop Antennas</strong> have a nice, discreet design. They are omni-directional and can be placed on any flat surface for better signal wherever you need it most. They can even be used in vehicles!</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Avoid Signal Oscillation Between Cellular Antennas</h2>
<p>Oscillation is one of the most common answers to the question: “Why doesn’t my cell signal booster work?”</p>
<p>It’s a feedback loop between your two antennas, caused by them <strong>being installed too close together</strong>.</p>
<p>Think of a speaker and a microphone. When you bring the microphone too close to a speaker, an unpleasant humming sound is created, with the screech getting louder and louder the closer they are together. This is oscillation, and it occurs with your antennas, too.</p>
<p>This is a problem that’s fixed by increasing the distance between the three components of your signal booster. Your antennas need to be <strong>at least 50 feet apart horizontally, or 20 feet vertically</strong> in order to prevent oscillation. Unfortunately, if you’ve set up your antennas for your ideal setup, you may have to move one or both antennas to a slightly less optimal position for you to get rid of the oscillation. However, this is balanced by the fact that the booster’s performance will dramatically increase, and that should more than make up for the fact that the broadcast antenna might not always be in the perfect position.</p>
<h2>How to Prevent Signal Booster Overload</h2>
<p>Most consumer boosters have the possibility of overload. If you’ve bought a cheaper signal booster, have fantastic outdoor signal but terrible indoor signal, and use high-gain antennas and cable, you might be <strong>delivering too much signal to your booster, and overloading it</strong>. This causes the booster to shut down completely, in order to save itself.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this is very easy to fix, with multiple options as to how you go about it.</p>
<p>If you want to throw money at the problem and deal with it easily, we sell attenuators to slightly decrease the amount of signal you’re bringing in and prevent overload. There are also commercial-grade boosters that automatically attenuate the signal you’re receiving, but they come with a rather high price tag and are overkill for most home setups.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to spend any more money, you’ll need to place your antenna differently. There are two options for this: placing it in a spot with weaker signal than where you have it or turning it away from a signal that’s too strong, thereby attenuating the signal. This is the easiest, cheapest method, if you don’t mind going on the roof again.</p>
<h2>What is a Vehicle Cellular Antenna, and How Do I Use Them?</h2>
<p>Vehicle antennas can be thought of as smaller, portable versions of indoor and outdoor antennas. The biggest difference is that every outdoor vehicle antenna is omnidirectional, since vehicles are prone to moving about and will need to constantly broadcast and downlink cellular signal. Thus, the difference between vehicle outdoor antennas is simply how large and powerful the antennas are.</p>
<h2>Magnet Mount Antennas: Easy to Use, Easy to Install</h2>

<p>Magnet mount antennas should need no introduction – they&#8217;re simply little antennas you <strong>mount magnetically to the frame of a vehicle</strong>. They provide minimal gain but have far and away the simplest installation, unless you have an aluminum frame. A magnet mount antenna can be used on any vehicle viably, but struggle at times to cover larger interiors.</p>
<p>The most common magnet mount antenna is the 4” magnet mount, which comes standard in vehicle signal booster kits. There are also <strong>12” magnet mounts, which provide a bit more gain</strong> across the standard cellular bandwidths. These are inexpensive upgrades and should be considered by anyone who is having issues covering the cabin of their vehicle with a powerful vehicle booster like the weBoost Drive Reach.</p>
<h2>Over-the-Road (OTR) Antennas: For Trucks and Large Cabins</h2>
<div class="blog-modern-product-box">
<div class="image"><img decoding="async" class="lazyautosizes lazyloaded" src="https://www.wilsonamplifiers.com/product_images/uploaded_images/wilson-drive-rv-antenna.png" sizes="195px" alt="Wilson Drive OTR Antenna - 311229" data-sizes="auto" data-src="/product_images/uploaded_images/wilson-drive-rv-antenna.png" /></div>

</div>
</div>
<p>An Over-the-Road Antenna is a mounted antenna designed <strong>for semi-trucks and RVs, but can be used in pickup trucks or large SUVs</strong>. These are much larger and more powerful than a magnet mount, but are more challenging to install. If you spend lots of time on the road, or have a large cabin or interior, an OTR antenna can be a very valuable investment.</p>
<p>There isn’t too much to go into here: an <strong>OTR is a more powerful omnidirectional vehicle antenna</strong>. If your vehicle is large enough to warrant it, you spend considerable time in your vehicle outside of urban areas, or you’re not getting the boost you need from a magnet mount and a powerful mobile booster, then an OTR will help you.</p>
<h2>NMO Antennas: Permanent Installations for Commercial Fleet Vehicles</h2>

<p>“NMO” (New Motorola Mount – yes, really) antennas are a bit of an odd duck in the vehicle space. For cellular purposes, they’re <strong>permanently installed in a fleet vehicle</strong> – whether that be a taxicab, delivery van, or semi-truck &#8211; in order to get increased gain over a magnet mount. These are very valuable for businesses which rely heavily on their fleets.</p>

<h2>Magnet Mount vs. OTR vs. NMO: Which Cellular Antenna is Best for My Vehicle?</h2>
<p>This is a simpler choice than with building antennas.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cars:</strong> 4” magnet mounts are sufficient for most cars. Upgrade: 12” magnet mount</li>
<li><strong>SUVs:</strong> 4” magnet mounts work on most SUVs. Upgrade: 12” magnet mount or OTR</li>
<li><strong>Pickup:</strong> 4” magnet mounts work on most pickups. Upgrade: 12” magnet mount or OTR</li>
<li><strong>RVs:</strong> OTR. 4” magnet mount will work in a pinch.</li>
<li><strong>Semi-trucks:</strong> OTR. 12” magnet mount will work in a pinch.</li>
<li><strong>Fleet vehicles of any type:</strong> NMO. OTRs will work as an alternative</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other Types of Vehicle Cellular Antennas</h2>
<p>There are a few other types of vehicle antennas to go over, but their use cases are less complex:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Marine antennas</strong> are large, waterproof antennas designed to be used aboard&#8230;well, marine vehicles. They can be used to ensure cellular coverage of a boat’s cabin up to several miles offshore. Get one of these if you have a boat.</li>
<li><strong>Low-profile antennas</strong> are the most common type of interior antenna for vehicles, being packaged in nearly every multi-user kit. They resemble candy bars and are designed not to stand out and transmit directionally.</li>
<li><strong>Desktop Antennas</strong> are small interior antennas best used in RVs or vehicles with extremely large cabins. They are trickier to place than low-profile antennas but provide slightly higher gain.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3>Is Higher dBi Better for Antennas?</h3>
<p>In general, yes. However, there are many reasons you might consider dropping a few dBi levels: convenience of installation, getting multiple carriers in your network, overall cost, and whether your booster is likely to overload from too much incoming signal.</p>
<h3>I’ve Heard Some Talk About 5G Cellular Antennas. What’s the Difference Between them and a 4G Cellular Antenna?</h3>
<p>A “5G” antenna usually adds the T-Mobile 5G band, which brings its range to 600-2700 MHz. These do nothing for Verizon or AT&amp;T 5G, which are broadcast on millimeter wave and not cellular bands. Thus, they can be used with 5G-compatible signal boosters on the T-Mobile 5G network.</p>
