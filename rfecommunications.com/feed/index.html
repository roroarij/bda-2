			<p>In today’s fast-paced business environment, reliable cellular communication is critical to the success of any commercial building. However, many commercial buildings suffer from poor cellular connection due to weak or nonexistent signals. This is where Bi-Directional Amplifier (BDA) systems come in. In this post, we&#8217;ll explain how BDA systems work and the benefits they can offer to commercial buildings&#8217; cellular connection.</p>

		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<h2>How BDA Systems Work</h2>
<p>BDA systems work by capturing weak cellular signals from outside the building, amplifying them, and then rebroadcasting them inside the building. BDA systems can use multiple antennas, each building is designed with its own unique layout and that will vary on how many antennas your building will need. The antennas are connected by a coaxial cable, which carries the amplified signal from the BDA to the internal antenna. BDA systems are designed to work with specific frequencies, such as those used by cell phone carriers. This allows them to capture and amplify only the signals that are relevant to cellular communication. By amplifying these signals, BDA systems can provide improved cellular coverage throughout the building, even in areas where the signal may have been weak or non-existent.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We live in a world that relies on various wireless technologies to communicate with one another. For the general consumer, infrastructure elements such as strong cellular, radio, and Wi-Fi signals have moved beyond being a luxury into a matter of safety and security. Radio and cellular signals are often weakened in large buildings and other venues due to a variety of factors, such as radio frequency interference, low-emissivity glass, concrete, and other building materials. These obstacles create areas within the structure that have little-to-no signal, rendering radios and cellular phones useless. Not only is this a source of frustration for building occupants, but it also interferes with the communication of first responders in cases of emergency. However, there are ways to mitigate these issues. Distributed Antenna Systems (DAS) improve connectivity for occupants, and newer building codes, such as Emergency Responder Radio Coverage (ERRC), address communication for Police, Fire, and other emergency personnel.</p>
<h2>The History of DAS</h2>
<p>A distributed antenna system, or DAS, is a dedicated antennae network that allows personal cellular signals to be sent and received within a building, hospital, hotel, or other large venues. It typically uses a carrier’s licensed frequencies and greatly improves voice and data connectivity for occupants inside these structures. Initially, cellular service was considered an exclusive agreement between the service provider and the properties that utilized their DAS frequencies. This was problematic for inhabitants that used a different provider, as they did not have access to a signal strong enough to provide reliable service. Another concern for those who lived or worked in taller buildings was that cellular signals weaken as the distance between a user and the signal increases. However, the evolution of these systems has made them more streamlined, allowing demarcation points to shift from property lines and MDF rooms to individual offices and/or units, thereby strengthening connectivity. Best practices for effective DAS design and application have been set forth by the Building Industry Consulting Services International (BICSI) and the Telecommunications Industry Association. DAS requirements remain stringent for government buildings and hotels; however multi-family Owners and Developers are able to utilize alternative methods, such as Wi-Fi and Emergency Responder Radio Coverage (ERRC), to maintain adequate signal strength to ensure safety of building tenants and staff.</p>
<h2>DAS and Wi-Fi</h2>
<p>Innovations in wireless technology have allowed Wi-Fi to add additional communication options to the architecture, engineering, and construction industries. It’s becoming an increasingly popular alternative to trusting cellular networks alone and can usually be found in common areas of multifamily properties, college campuses, as well as conference rooms and offices. While Wi-Fi is a viable alternative to cellular signals, it can still fail if a user’s signal is weak. That failure can quickly become dangerous if that user is a first responder. In 2018, new requirements were initiated to strengthen wireless connectivity inside buildings, ensuring that communication would be available when wanted and, more importantly, when needed.</p>
<h2>The Rise of ERRC</h2>
<p>Emergency Responder Radio Coverage (ERRC) refers to the code requirements surrounding radio strength within a building. It is similar to DAS but utilizes different frequencies and legalities. Its main purpose is to help firefighters, police officers, and paramedics establish points of operation and communication, allowing them to respond to emergencies within buildings. While it is possible to use ERRC in place of a DAS or Wi-Fi connectivity, it is inadvisable to do so. ERRC is intended to run on one antenna using one frequency. Adding additional frequencies for non-emergency communication is cost-prohibitive, making a DAS or Wi-Fi a better option for everyday communication.</p>
<p>Before ERRC was developed, emergency personnel often wasted valuable time and resources finding an outdoor location with a signal strong enough to support their radio communication both inside and outside a given building. ERRC not only regulates the signal strength, it includes software with graphics for police, firefighters, and medics to track and monitor where personnel are located while onsite. However, despite these valuable benefits to first responders, these types of systems present specific design challenges that are best piloted by Federal Communications Commission (FCC)-licensed partners both because of their cost and safety implications.</p>
<p>Equipment needs for adequate service can vary because the strength of a signal inside a building can differ based on a number of factors, including what the building is made from or its proximity to a cell tower. Some projects may not need any additional equipment to boost signal strength. Other projects located in areas where cell towers are less prevalent or perhaps made from different building materials might require a more detailed system to support a signal strong enough for the safety of occupants and first responders. Also, installation costs can vary by manufacturer and location, potentially resulting in higher-than-expected initial expenses.</p>
<h2>Code Updates and Their Impact</h2>
<p>The importance of improving indoor connectivity for first responders came to light after the release of the Post-9/11 Commission Report in 2005. Before this, fire fighters relied upon phone jacks installed near stairways for communication indoors with personnel in the building’s fire control room. While having adequate radio signals indoors renders the jacks unnecessary, building codes still require them to be installed unless exempted by the respective fire marshal. In many cases, fire marshals need to be educated on ERRC applications and prevalence in contrast to what has been done in the past.</p>
<p>Subsequent building code updates have been enacted to ensure proper indoor signal strength for both new and existing buildings. While these new codes are determined by authorities having jurisdiction (AHJ) and can sometimes be county-driven, fire code officials are in charge of approving the system and frequencies. An FCC-issued General Radio Operator’s License (GROL) is required, as well as training and OEM Certification or skill satisfactory to the AHJ. Emergency generators need two hours of battery backup under this updated code, and if there is no emergency generator, 12 hours of battery backup are required. There are also minimum requirements for inbound and outbound signals’ delivered audio quality.</p>
<p>In the most recent version of the IFC code, signal boosters and system monitoring protocols were revised, including:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Battery systems for emergency power must be housed in NEMA 3R cabinets.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Any donor antenna must be isolated from interior antennae no less than 20dB greater than the system gain under all operating conditions.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Installing system amplifiers, or any system that might interfere with an ERRC system, must be coordinated and approved by the fire code official.</li>
<li aria-level="1">ERRC systems must be monitored by a fire alarm control unit or sound an audible alarm, as approved by a fire code official.</li>
<li aria-level="1">There should also be automatic signals for any of the following: loss of AC power supply, battery charge and RF-emitting device failures, antenna malfunctions, failure of critical system components, and for communication links between the fire alarm system and the emergency responder radio enhancement system.</li>
</ul>
<p>In regard to existing buildings without an approved communication system, one can be installed within a timeframe established by the AHJ. While it’s the building Owner’s responsibility to adhere to the code and meet annual recertification requirements, project partners can provide plans to help meet code requirements. System integrators must design and install ERRC systems using FCC-certified equipment in NEMA-4 enclosures. Signal testing falls under the responsibility of the Owner, integrator, and often the third party and is required to be completed annually.</p>
<p>According to the current code, a building’s ERRC system must cover at least 95% of public safety frequencies, and contractors that provide the designs and installation of ERRC systems must be licensed by the FCC.</p>
<h2>The Cost of Lacking Coverage</h2>
<p>ERRC and DAS can be retroactively implemented for existing buildings; however, the time, resources, and coordination to do so can complicate the process for many Owners and Developers. Fire marshals can bring a project to a halt during the final stages if signal strength standards are not fully met. If you leave these systems out of the planning and design phases of a project, one risks incurring additional expenses and subsequently rushing other phases of construction to stay on task. Retrofitting ERRC and DAS systems during or after construction often results in higher rates from project partners, due to an increase in the amount of coordination and materials needed to modify signal strength and coverage. For example, cables for emergency generators typically cost less than one dollar, but the price can rise to six times that amount for out-of-sequence system construction. In the near future, building codes will require annual signal strength testing, which will shrink the margin of error for system planning and implementation. When this update takes effect, it is best addressed by seasoned partners who can expertly plan and design communication systems, as well as coordinate signal strength testing efficiently.</p>
<h2>Closing</h2>
<p>DAS and Wi-Fi connectivity are highly technical systems and require experienced project partners to ensure that best practices are being adhered to. ERRC systems for emergency responders require coordination with FCC-licensed partners, code compliance, and extraordinary attention to detail.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What’s the difference between passive and active distributed antenna systems (DAS)? We hear this question a lot in our field. To put it simply, a distributed antenna system, or DAS, is a clustered installation of antennas to boost cellular network coverage in areas with weak signal.</p>
<h2>ACTIVE DAS</h2>
<p>Active DAS simply means the components require a power source to operate. Building owners, property managers, and enterprise customers have a number of options when there’s a cellular coverage problem. Traditionally, so-called Active Distributed Antenna Systems (DAS) were the only alternative for many customers. These systems are expensive and take months to deploy, although for customers with capacity issues (think football stadium or airport) it is the preferred solution. Permission to connect to a carrier network is often a long, time-consuming process. For each additional carrier, the process has to be repeated each time.</p>
<p>Active DAS solutions are costly and can take several months up to a year to install. As a rule of thumb, any high-traffic building over 500,000 sq. ft. needing complete wall-to-wall coverage should consider Active DAS.</p>
<h2>PASSIVE DAS</h2>
<p>Passive DAS systems tend to use passive components like coaxial cable, splitters, and diplexers to distribute signal, and unlike active DAS, they use bi-directional amplifiers to re-broadcast signal from a macro cellular network using either an over-the-air donor antenna or a “small cell” from each carrier. This means that Passive DAS heavily rely on adequate signal from a nearby cell tower – a great solution for urban areas.</p>
<p>For a complete Passive DAS installation, the total cost is greatly less expensive than Active DAS and the time required installing ranges from days to a few weeks or months.</p>
<h2>THE BOTTOM LINE</h2>
<p>As a general rule, Passive DAS is the best choice for buildings up to 100,000 square feet, but can also be scaled upwards to 500,000 square feet. A Passive DAS is much more cost-effective and can provide appropriate cellular coverage in most commercial buildings.</p>
<p>Active DAS need be employed in complex, sprawling high-traffic areas like airports, stadiums, convention centers, and other structures over 500,000 square feet.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When we talk about ‘In-Building Wireless’ (IBW), what do we actually mean?</p>
<p>Though ‘IBW” may sound like one set-in-stone solution, in actuality, that single term encompasses an entire class of diverse, specialized solutions and technologies – that enterprise owners, managers and architects must understand in order to implement the right IBW solution for their space, and balance the benefits and costs of each effectively.</p>
<p>Typically, when considering IBW, the technologies being considered will be one of the two more significant classes of IBW solution; either distributed antenna systems (DAS), or small cells.</p>
<p>And while the two do share some physical and configuration similarities, they do operate differently. So what’s the difference between the two and what advantages can they offer?</p>
<h2>UNDERSTANDING DAS AND SMALL CELLS</h2>
<p>As we’ve already explored in previous posts, there are multiple considerations to make when selecting an IBW solution. There’s no such thing as a ‘one size fits all’ solution! The size of the space, energy usage and costs, as well as how many operators you will need to interface with, are just a few factors to address – and will influence whether DAS or small cells are a better option.</p>
<h2>DAS: POWERFUL AND SCALABLE IN-BUILDING WIRELESS COVERAGE FOR LARGE VENUES</h2>
<p>What is DAS? Built from a networked series of remote antennas, or nodes, DAS (distributed antenna systems) is one of the industry’s longest-established wireless coverage and capacity technologies.</p>
<p>DAS is an inherently scalable solution, meaning it can be expanded to cover larger spaces and unusually shaped areas. For example, when cellular service is added to a subway tunnel, arena or in an area such as a tunneled mountain road, it’s likely being provided with DAS.</p>
<p>What is DAS a suitable solution for? DAS is an effective means of delivering a uniformly high quality of service (QoS) wireless coverage and robust capacity across:</p>
<p>Large indoor areas such as high-rise office buildings, hotels and large hospitals</p>
<p>A contiguous outdoor area, such as a stadium or sports arena.</p>
<p>A combination of indoor and outdoor environments, such as a college campus.</p>
<p>Of course, not all DAS solutions are the same. So even if an area suits a DAS solution, it’s important to recognize that indoor spaces should be covered by low-power DAS, and outdoor spaces should be served by high-power DAS. The latest generation of DAS solutions can also integrate both low-and high-power networks into a single, unified platform for mixed environments.</p>
<p>Note that each DAS installation will be unique to the environment it serves – there are no ‘out of the box’ DAS solutions. There are, however, new options that help to simplify the installation process, with intelligence-enabled automatic configuration, and an alternative means of signal transport, such as via an existing IT cabling infrastructure.</p>
<p>As a distributed antenna system, DAS connects to an operator’s network through that operator’s own base station, meaning DAS is able to work with one, many or all available wireless operators.</p>
<p>What does DAS infrastructure require? DAS generally relies on RF cable (coaxial cable) to link antenna remotes, and uses fiber-optic cable to connect floors and other discrete areas. These two types of cable then connect to a central processing point (the headend). Newer, more advanced DAS solutions will, today, operate on IT structured cabling instead of coaxial. This offers a number of benefits, from ease (and reduced cost) of installation, to supporting other networks and functions such as Wi-Fi and security systems.</p>
<h2>SMALL CELLS: AFFORDABLE, ADAPTIVE COVERAGE SOLUTIONS FOR SMALLER INDOOR LOCATIONS</h2>
<p>Despite the many benefits that DAS presents (and reductions in cost), for smaller enterprise environments it may not be the most economic solution. Instead, for smaller indoor locations, small cells present a flexible, self-contained and more cost-effective solution.</p>
<p>What are small cells? Essentially small cells are just that; small versions of macro cell sites, including base station, radio and antennas, usually combined into a single physical unit.</p>
<p>What are small cells suitable for? In deployments such as small-to-medium office buildings, where day-to-day demand remains fairly consistent and user distribution and demand doesn’t vary much, small cells offer ideal support.</p>
<p>Essentially, small cells suit small-to-medium spaces with consistent demand.</p>
<p>What infrastructure do small cells require? As a relatively easy to install (and cost-effective) option, small cells are an attractive solution for enterprise environments.</p>
<p>However, there are still a number of considerations that need to be made with small cells:</p>
<h3>OPERATOR SUPPORT</h3>
<p>Unlike DAS solutions, which connect to an outside base station, owned by a wireless operator, small cells include their own baseband unit that must be integrated with operator networks – a one time process. As a result, most major operators have only integrated a limited number of small cells (some have not integrated any). And while this situation is improving slowly, it’s important to keep in mind that small cell solutions typically only support one operator’s network.</p>
<p>Interference prevention. In a small cell solution, each small cell creates a discrete ‘cell’ of coverage; and like macro sites, traditional small cells also create overlap areas where cell boundaries meet. As these cross-over areas can cause a significant decrease in service quality (such as dropped connections, choppy voice, reduced data rates), it’s important that solution design, and cell placement is well considered and optimized – though it’s impossible to eliminate cross-sector interference completely.</p>
<p>Coverage and capacity limits</p>
<p>If you’re considering a small cell deployment, but expect to significantly expand your IBW solution in future, bear in mind that small cells have a hard upper limit on capacity and coverage. They can reliably support 16-64 users at a time, which for many small to mid-sized enterprise environments will be more than adequate. You should also consider that conventional small cells cannot dynamically share capacity between access points, meaning that large groups of users in small spaces (such as cafeterias) can create bottlenecks.</p>
<h2>CHOOSING THE RIGHT IBW SOLUTION</h2>
<p>Whether a DAS or small cell deployment is right for you will depend on a number of factors, from the size of the space, to the number of users, to capacity demands – and, of course, budget.</p>
<p>DAS and small cells account for the majority of IBW solutions, covering small, medium and large enterprise environments. Of course, IBW solutions are always evolving and improving; leading to more economic, greater performing IBW and giving owners, managers and architects – as well as installers – a greater array of options over time. For owners, managers and architects this is great – it means more choice when it comes to IBW but also, from an engineers perspective, regular IBW innovations increase the importance of maintaining up to date wireless training certifications.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">State-of-the-art emergency responder communication systems are critical in daily operations and emergency situations alike. Natural disasters, fires, large crime scenes, or even everyday accidents require a swift and reliable system for first responders. It’s no secret that the quantity and severity of mass shootings in the U.S. is on an upward trajectory that shows no sign of abatement. Many of these horrific events occur inside schools, hospitals and office buildings where First Responder radio systems have coverage challenges.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The solution to in-building radio coverage problems is best accomplished through the use of what’s called an Emergency Responder Radio Communication System, or ERRCS.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An <strong>ERRCS</strong> is quite similar to an Over-the-Air Cellular DAS. It used a donor antenna to receive the radio signals from the local first-responder network. These signals operate on private frequencies. The radio signals are then re-amplified in the building in areas that do not get adequate signal.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As a general contractor, construction project manager, or building owner, you may know that many jurisdictions now require NFPA (National Fire Protection Association) or IFC (International Fire Code) compliant public safety and emergency responder coverage (ERRC) as a prerequisite for getting an occupancy permit. You may even be confident that your building requires a public safety coverage solution (ERRCS) of some kind. But understanding the details of how coverage is tested and how it can be improved is complicated and varies greatly by jurisdiction. Local rules are mandated by the Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ), oftentimes the Fire Marshall.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Jurisdiction mandates will determine </span><span class="s1">what frequencies need to operate inside the building (800/700 MHz but occasionally VHF and UHF frequencies) and at what locations and strength. Generally, there will be system-testing requirements to get an initial permit and a required annual maintenance contract to ensure the system remains operational.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Building tenants and property owners are often looking for qualified resources to assist with the technical aspects of an ERRCS. At In-Building Wireless Solutions, we assist with education of the appropriate fire codes and technology solutions currently available. Working with public safety authorities, we can inform your staff of the current jurisdiction mandates, test the current signal strength readings of existing buildings in your area, and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If required design a cost-effective system that will comply with local codes.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We work on behalf of owners to understand the exact requirements and minimize the costs associated with implementation. It is often the case that testing of the building and discussion with the AHJ can substantially reduce the costs associated with implementing an ERRCS.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For facilities managers, building owners and architects, building wireless solutions should be front of mind to ensure the best enterprise connectivity options available.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of course, there are situations, where clients are unfamiliar with solutions other than Wi-Fi, or concern over building wireless complexity vs. Wi-Fi simplicity causes hesitation. However, most enterprise networks will need the advanced level of connectivity support that IBW provides, rather than Wi-Fi alone.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As wireless companies continue to bombard building owners with 5G advertisements, building owners are left attempting to make sense of what the best wireless solution is for their building.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">From an engineer’s perspective, deploying IBW is simpler than ever before. For the client, it’s also much easier to gain guidance on what IBW solution would best suit their unique requirements (DAS? Small cell? Single-operator, multi-operator, high-power, low-power, etc), and to receive the support needed to implement and manage the right solution.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Regardless of the IBW solution adopted however, there are typically similar steps involved in deployment – that both engineers and their clients should be aware of and understand for seamless implementation.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">STEP 1: SCHEDULE A MEETING TO DETERMINE OVERALL REQUIREMENTS FOR YOUR DESIGN</span></h3>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">With our company, our first step is to meet with you to better understand your needs and discuss the requirements for the WLAN. During this meeting, we will discuss the requirements and capacity for your building, as well as your security needs. If you don’t have all the answers, don’t worry. In fact, many people don’t. That’s why we’re here: to help you understand and guide you through the process.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">STEP 2: WE WILL SURVEY THE SITE</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For existing buildings, a site survey should be conducted to evaluate the signal quality of the different mobile operators and to identify optimum installation locations for radio remote units and antennas. This will require access to building floor plans and the use of site survey tools that can test for signal quality and RF interference.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A provisional RF design is recommended for buildings that are still under construction. The building construction and design team should prepare a preliminary RF design to be included with the initial building plans. A provisional RF design can provide a best estimation of RF penetration based on the structure, materials and floor plan of the building.</span></p>
<h3 class="p4"><span class="s1">STEP 3: INSTALLATION AND DEPLOYMENT</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our installation engineers are held to the highest standards and are committed to producing a high quality DAS system. We will never compromise the quality of our work, but will always finish on time and on budget.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Having established your blueprint for your DAS project, it then becomes time to put your plan into action and begin installation. Here are the basic steps we will go through for a successful installation.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">End-to-end DAS installation</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Full construction management</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Head-end equipment installation and testing.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">System optimization and acceptance testing.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Macro network optimization.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Public safety compliance and coordination.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Building wireless solutions are always evolving, and are now more affordable, versatile and easier to install than ever before; great news for enterprise environments, who increasingly need to ensure high quality, continuous connectivity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of course, this is also great news for infrastructure professionals and those who maintain the right wireless training, will be best placed to stay ahead of the curve in an evolving and expanding market.
