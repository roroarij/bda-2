The company collaborates with clients and customers all around Texas with a focus in the Houston area, such as the City of Houston, North Harris Country Regional Water Authority, Houston Water Works Team, and many more. The acquisition will expand the customer base even further.</p><p>While the concentration of BLTI has always been system integration and control panel fabrication, we are also a leader in the industry as a provider of security and fire systems. "Partnering with Inframark will provide BL Technology the opportunity to take the current success of the company to an even greater level. This will allow us to collaborate with other SCADA companies within the Inframark organization to provide SCADA Solutions at the national level. We are thrilled with what the future holds with the Inframark/BL Technology Team," said Bob Lee, COO of BLTI.</p><p>With more than 40 years of experience in managing water-related infrastructure, Inframark employs 2,500 people serving more than 400 clients in 21 states.

It also manages 10,000 miles of wastewater collection and water distribution networks. Its Infrastructure Management Services group serves 220 clients with financial, administrative, and specialized support services.</p><p>"We are proud and excited to add an organization like BLTI to the Inframark family and look forward to the continued involvement of the entire team that has driven the success of the Company," said Jim Irwin, Inframarks Vice President of Corporate Development. Irwin added, "BLTI represents Inframark's fourth acquisition of leaders in the SCADA market and signifies our commitment to helping customers optimize and efficiently operate their water, wastewater, and infrastructure assets."</p><p>Generational Equity Executive Managing Director of M&amp;A – Central Region, <a href="https://www.genequityco.com/our-people/michael-goss"><span class="InternetLink" data-redactor-tag="span" data-redactor-class="InternetLink" data-verified="redactor">Michael Goss</span></a>, and his team successfully closed the transaction.
