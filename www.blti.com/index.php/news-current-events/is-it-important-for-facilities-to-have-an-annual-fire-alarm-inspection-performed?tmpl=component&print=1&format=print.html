			<div  class="ebd-block   " data-type="text" ><p>While having a fire alarm system professionally installed at your facility is an excellent measure to help mitigate your fire risk, having an excellent monitoring company paired with annual inspections enables you to ensure the system is functioning properly and will be reliable in the event of an actual fire.</p><p>Most all counties will require facilities have an annual inspection performed, and typically insurance providers will request a copy of the inspection reports after the inspection is completed. If you are missing these, the insurance company would have a legal right to dispute or deny any claims. Worse is if a fire should occur in your facility, and someone is injured or killed, you could end up with a costly legal nightmare. </p><p>Remember, your facility's fire alarm system is a part of your front-line defense in the event of a fire as it will alert occupants to evacuate the facility. The county and your insurance companies are not looking to make managing your fire alarm system expensive or a hassle, it's necessary to ensure that your fire alarm system is in proper working order to ensure the safety of the people within your facility.</p></div>
