			<div  class="ebd-block   " data-type="text" ><p>Imagine finding yourself at the top of a building, with fire all around you, smoke increasing, and in need of assistance. You are a firefighter, EMT, or police officer, trying to signal on your radio, but you are too high up, your radio's frequency can't get through. What do you do? </p><p>Bi-Directional Amplifiers&nbsp;are signal boosters that sustain two-way radio communication throughout a facility. This includes stairwells, underground tunnels, parking garages and so much more. Think of how important a BDA system could be for a firefighter, police offer, or even an office staff member in a tall building. BDA has saved lives by simply making sure first responders can communicate with their team. Imagine if we had BDA systems available when 9/11 occurred. There would have been seamless&nbsp;communication between the towers and the countless lives that could have been saved. One of the primary issues&nbsp;of 9/11 issues was simply a lack of being able to communicate with their teams on the ground. Brave&nbsp;firefighters were&nbsp;doing their job and heading up&nbsp;the stairwell with no signal, no information, and no way out.</p></div>

<div  class="ebd-block   " data-type="text" ><p>The BDA system is an amplifier/repeater designed to boost and distribute a signal covering various frequencies. The BDA System can be part of a Distributed Antenna System (DAS) which is a network of separate antenna nodes connected to a common transport medium. The BDA System even allows a facility to be in compliance with Emergency Responder Radio Coverage Code (ERRC).</p></div>

<div  class="ebd-block   " data-type="text" ><p>BLTI is a&nbsp;provider of BDA systems, and we support these systems since we want to do our part to ensure&nbsp;any first responder, customer, or office worker ever has to&nbsp;be in a position where they can't&nbsp;communicate and possibly&nbsp;lose their life because of it. We have the experience&nbsp;to test communication in your facility, and determine if and where these wireless signal boosters are needed to enhance communications and potentially&nbsp;save lives.</p><p><span style="font-size: inherit; font-family: inherit; text-align: inherit;">We would be happy to complete an assessment of your building's ability to transmit signals throughout your facility and determine what areas may require a BDA to be installed to ensure first responders can remain in contact with their team on the ground. <a href="https://blti.com/index.php/contact-us" title="Contact BLTI Today!
