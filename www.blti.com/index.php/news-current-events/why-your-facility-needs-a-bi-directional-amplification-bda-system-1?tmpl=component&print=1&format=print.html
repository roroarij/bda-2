			<div  class="ebd-block   " data-type="text" ><p>In the event of an emergency, you need first responders to be able to access your facility and communicate with their teams outside with no delay or interference. One of the major complaints voiced during these critical situations by first responders is the ability to communicate to their teams and encountering dead spots within a building.</p><p>Don't let your building have dead spots where it leaves first responders without a way to call for help or ask for information. By adding a Bi-Directional Amplifier (BDA) system to your facility, you are helping ensure that first responders can do their job as safely and efficiently as possible.</p><p><b data-redactor-tag="b">How Does a BDA System Work? </b></p><p>       A BDA system helps to ensure that there are consistent two-way communications by amplifying transmissions using a repeater antenna on the outside of your facility connecting to boosters within your facility to negate the potential for dead spots. This set-up helps to boost the signal strength by expanding the coverage of Radio Frequency (RF) thru your facility. </p></div>

<div  class="ebd-block   " data-type="text" ><p><b data-redactor-tag="b">Do You Really Need a BDA System? </b></p>       Various organizations like the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and International Fire Council (IFC) continually work to update the standards for life safety in facilities, including signal coverage for first responders. You may want to check with your county Fire Marshall as they are continually updating facility requirements, and BDA's may have already been added as a requirement for your county.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Not being in compliance may cost you, not only money but people's lives.
