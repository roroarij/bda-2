Samsara has emerged as one of the leading Industrial IoT </span><i data-redactor-tag="i" style="font-size: inherit; font-family: inherit; text-align: inherit;">(Internet of Things)</i><span> companies in the world today. The wireless IoT platform from Samsara lends flexibility to connect to virtually every type of asset via their cloud-based architecture to collect data from Field Instrumentation, PLC's </span><i data-redactor-tag="i" style="font-size: inherit; font-family: inherit; text-align: inherit;">(Programmable Logic Controller)</i><span>, RTU's </span><i data-redactor-tag="i" style="font-size: inherit; font-family: inherit; text-align: inherit;">(Remote Thermal Unit)</i><span>, VFD's</span><i data-redactor-tag="i" style="font-size: inherit; font-family: inherit; text-align: inherit;"> (Variable Frequency Drive)</i><span>, and others to provide real-time visibility into your operations.</span><br></p><p>What is Real-Time? The wireless IoT platform from Samsara provides a one-second data resolution from the sensor to the cloud. All data is date and time stamped for the purpose of future reporting. The real-time nature of this platform, coupled with the Open API <i data-redactor-tag="i">(Application Programming Interface)</i> using RESTful <i data-redactor-tag="i">(Representational State Transfer)</i> and JSON <i data-redactor-tag="i">(JavaScript Object Notation)</i> calls, enables us to meet the growing demand to feed historical reporting, AI <i data-redactor-tag="i">(Artificial Intelligence)</i>, and Business Intelligence platforms</p><p>The wireless IoT platform from BLTI/Samsara breathes new life into brownfield or aging systems by allowing clients to seamlessly integrate with legacy control systems via Modbus RTU and Modbus TCP <i data-redactor-tag="i">(Transmission Control Protocol)</i> and easily develop real-time dashboards that can be viewed by unlimited subscribers within the organization. Customization of dashboards for departmental use can be developed quickly and without ever disconnecting from the process for system upgrades.</p><p>Furthermore, the wireless Industrial Controller can be used for greenfield applications as it does provide IEC-61131 control programming to develop control strategies in addition to the wireless connectivity to the cloud. Simply put, BLTI's (Samsara) wireless IoT solution combines the functionality of:</p> <ul><li>Controller â€“ PLC's or RTU's</li> <li>HMI <i data-redactor-tag="i">(Human-Machine Interface)</i> or SCADA <i data-redactor-tag="i">(Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition)</i> platform</li> <li>Real-Time Data Historian</li> <li>Analysis and Reporting Software</li> <li>The ability to combine all of this functionality into one tightly integrated platform enables BLTI to provide cost-effective alternatives to traditional SCADA and PLC-based control systems.</li></ul> <div><br></div><strong data-redactor-tag="strong" data-verified="redactor">Who benefits from Wireless IoT Solutions from BLTI?</strong> <p><span><br>BLTI takes pride in the fact that we have a rich 47-year history in the Water/Wastewater industry. Historically, we have experienced instances with small to medium size municipalities that may not have the considerable budgets needed to deploy a traditional SCADA system. This scenario plays out in all vertical markets. Small to medium size Oil and Gas Production companies, Oil and Gas Gathering, and Packaged System Manufacturers all reach a point where they compromise remote monitoring and data gathering initiatives due to the unfavorable economics associated with deploying legacy technologies. BLTI's solution by Samsara enables our clients to have the functionality they want without compromise that is economically feasible and provides a favorable ROI (Return on Investment).</span><br></p> <strong data-redactor-tag="strong" data-verified="redactor">What does a Value-Added Reseller Do?</strong> <p><span><br>As a value-added reseller, BLTI can support our customers in several ways. BLTI will work with I&amp;E and Control System engineers to design, fabricate, install and commission systems, as well as, provide migration services to integrate our wireless IoT solution with existing systems in the field to provide wireless remote access, data gathering, and alarm management for legacy systems. Our goal is to provide the most economically feasible wireless IoT solution for our existing and future customers.</span>&nbsp;</p></div>
