A one-size-fits-all solution no longer works for modern security needs. This is where the beauty of integration arises. BLTI can create partnerships with differing solutions, where teamwork can make your dream work. Connecting like puzzle pieces, the ability of a video management system to integrate with your current system is essential not only to your solution but to your budget.</span></p><p>An example of this is <a href="https://security.gallagher.com/en-US/Solutions/Integrated-solutions" target="_blank">Gallagher's Command Centre integration solutions</a>.
