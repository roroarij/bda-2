			<div  class="ebd-block   " data-type="text" ><p>Houston is one of the largest metroplexes in the United States.&nbsp; The Greater Houston area&nbsp;comprises&nbsp;Houston proper and&nbsp;many small towns, villages, neighborhoods, and rural areas on the outskirts.&nbsp; Approximately seven million people live in the greater Houston area, and all expect clean drinking water at home and work.&nbsp; Hundreds of water districts and thousands of miles of plumbing are in place to deliver clean water and remove wastewater.&nbsp; The one element that no one thinks about when they turn on their faucet is,&nbsp;"How does this water get here?"&nbsp; &nbsp;One of the key elements to ensuring we all enjoy clean water is the use of SCADA systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size: inherit; font-family: inherit; text-align: inherit;">SCADA, or Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition, is a control system widely used in various industries, including water treatment. SCADA systems monitor and control various processes and equipment remotely, using sensors and actuators to gather data and perform automated tasks. In water treatment plants, SCADA systems monitor and control different processes and equipment involved in water treatment.</span></p><p>One major use of SCADA in water treatment is for monitoring and controlling the quality of the water being treated. Sensors and analyzers gather data on various parameters such as pH, temperature, and chemical levels. This data is then used to adjust the treatment process and ensure that the water meets the required quality standards.</p><p>SCADA systems are also used to monitor and control the various pumps, valves, and other equipment used in the water treatment process. For example, pumps can move water through different stages of treatment, such as filtration and disinfection. Valves can control the flow of water and ensure that it is directed to the correct location. By using SCADA to monitor and control these processes, water treatment plants can ensure that the treated water is of the highest quality and that the treatment process is operating efficiently.</p><p>In addition to monitoring and controlling the water treatment process, SCADA systems can also monitor and control other aspects of water treatment plants, such as energy usage and maintenance schedules. By using SCADA to track energy usage, water treatment plants can identify areas where energy can be saved, and by using SCADA to schedule maintenance, plants can ensure that equipment is adequately maintained and any issues are addressed on time.</p><p>Overall, SCADA systems play a critical role in the operation of water treatment plants, helping to ensure that the water being treated is of the highest quality and that the treatment process is operating efficiently. By using SCADA to monitor and control various processes and equipment, water treatment plants can improve the efficiency of their operations and provide high-quality water to their customers.</p><p>If you are interested in an Audit or upgrade of your internal SCADA systems for your water treatment facilities, contact BLTI.&nbsp; &nbsp;We are the experts in SCADA for Water treatment facilities in Houston and would be glad to help.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p></div>
